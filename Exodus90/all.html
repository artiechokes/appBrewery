  <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in
    your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
  <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
    transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
  <p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
    This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and which gives
    us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross.
    Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end.
    Let us be transformed!</p>
  <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season of
    Lent.</p>
  <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
  <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
  <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
      Thy kingdom come.
      Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
      Give us this day our daily bread.
      And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
      And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
      Amen.</em></p>
  <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
  <p><em>And they came to Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimae′us,
      a blind beggar, the son of Timae′us, was sitting by the roadside. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth,
      he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” And many rebuked him, telling him to be
      silent; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.”
      And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; rise, he is calling you.” And throwing off his mantle
      he sprang up and came to Jesus. And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said
      to him, “Master, let me receive my sight.” And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And
      immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.</em></p>
  <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
  <p>The last sign that Jesus works in St. John’s Gospel is the raising of Lazarus.
    In St. Mark’s Gospel, the last miracle that Jesus works before his triumphant entrance into Jerusalem is the curing
    of the blind man—a man who is the son of a Gentile (Timaeus) but who is named as a Hebrew, Bartimaeus.
    This last miracle unites the entire message of the Gospel up to this point: Christ has come to extend his redemption
    beyond Israel to all men.
    He comes to undo the curse of Adam and to transform us into the sons of God.
    He wants us to call out in prayer to him in the midst of our suffering and ask for his mercy.
    We call out when we pray, when we fast, and when we extend mercy to others.
    And in these activities, Christ comes to us, enters our experience, and transforms it, giving us a share in his
    divine life and redemptive work. </p>
  <p>He gives us faith so that we can know God as he does.
    And having faith, we can follow him in hope, confident that he will supply for all we lack, enabling us to go where
    he is going and do what he is doing.
    Often We often hear Christians say that such and such a charitable act is the work of a Mother Teresa, or that
    intense prayer is what monks do.
    The implication is that what Christ did and the way he did it is only obtainable by a select few.
    Instead, St. Mark’s Gospel tells us: ask God to transform you into Christ.
    Deepen your experience of faith: hear God’s word!
    Strive to see his face!
    Do everything you can to make this gift a reality, even though nothing you can do will ever earn such a gift.
    Pray!
    Fast!
    Give alms!
    And have confidence that he will transform you.
    Get up and follow him, even to his Cross.</p>
  <p>But as you follow him in faith and hope, it will become clear that there is yet a further and more perfect way that
    Christ wishes to transform you.
    We will consider the virtue of charity next week.</p>

        <p><strong>You are in Jerusalem.</strong>
          At last, we have arrived in Jerusalem.
          This is the final week of preparation for our encounter with the Risen Christ.
          We have focused on preparing though prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. We have spent the last two weeks
          meditating on how we are interiorly transformed to be Christ in faith and in hope.
          Now this week, we will focus on the greatest transformation: our transformation to love with Christ’s love.
          Let us be transformed!</p>

        <p><em>And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Beth′phage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of
            his disciples, and said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you will
            find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it. If any one says to you, ‘Why are you
            doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’” And they went away, and
            found a colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it. And those who stood there said to
            them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” And they told them what Jesus had said; and they let them go.
            And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it. And many spread
            their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields. And those
            who went before and those who followed cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
            Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna in the highest!” And he entered
            Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had looked round at everything, as it was already late, he
            went out to Bethany with the twelve.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Palm Sunday is an intermediate day, partly anticipating the joy of Easter, partly anticipating the deep
          sorrows of the Cross.
          If the Transfiguration of Christ manifests to us the virtue of hope, Palm Sunday is a manifestation to us of
          divine charity, partially hidden, and partially revealed. </p>
        <p>St. Paul writes that there are three virtues that endure into heaven because they pertain to God.
          These virtues are more divine than human, transforming us even now to enable us to participate in the
          divine-human life of Jesus Christ.
          Those three virtues are faith, hope, and love.
          St. Paul adds that the greatest of these is love.
          Love is the crown of the virtues, the most God-like activity that we can do.
          God alone perfectly loves himself, with the Father infinitely breathing forth the Spirit of Love upon his Son.
          All creatures are made God-like to the extent that they love as God loves.
          No creature can love the infinitely lovable God as much as he can and should be loved; they can only love God
          as much they are able, striving always to contemplate God with love.
          Perpetual, conscious contemplation of God belongs to eternal life.
          Only those purified beings in heaven are capable of that perfection of love.</p>
        <p>But in this life, we must love consciously and unconsciously.
          A husband cannot think of his wife every second, but he must still be faithful to his vows at every moment of
          the day, even when he is not consciously thinking of his wife.
          So too for Christians in this life, we will need to sleep, focus on difficult tasks, and the rest, but at all
          times we must live such that nothing we do or think is more important to us than God.
          Further, everything we do needs to be ultimately—if not always consciously—ordered to God.
          Just as a married man must order all of his work toward loving and caring for his wife, so too must we order
          all we do to our loving relationship with God. </p>
        <p>We are in an intermediate stage: at times our love for God is manifest and conscious, and at times it is
          hidden and unconscious.
          The grace God has poured into our hearts is hidden, but the more conscious acts of love we make, the more we
          strive to live in God’s presence, the more we will experience his grace flowing into our hearts.
          Although the perfection of the saints in heaven is not yet possible to us, we must nevertheless endeavor to
          emulate it.
          During this last week of Lent, it is especially good to be as consciously attentive to God and to make as many
          acts of love of him as possible.
          Every act of love will make our love for God increase.</p>
        <p>On this Palm Sunday, make conscious acts of love toward God, rejoicing in his love and goodness, and praying
          to be transformed by his Paschal love.</p>
        <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

        <p><em>On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing in the distance a fig tree
            in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves,
            for it was not the season for figs. And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his
            disciples heard it. And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who
            sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of
            those who sold pigeons; and he would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple. And he taught,
            and said to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But
            you have made it a den of robbers.” And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to
            destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. And when evening
            came they went out of the city.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>After triumphantly entering into Jerusalem, Jesus returns to Bethany to stay with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.
          On the next morning he returns to Jerusalem, and on the way he curses the barren fig tree.
          Adam and Eve had clothed themselves in the leaves of the fig tree, but Jesus declares it is no longer the time
          for the fallen dispensation.
          He has come to replace the fig tree with the tree of life, the tree of the Cross which he will plant in the
          heart of every man.</p>
        <p>The fig-tree was a sign of hiding from God, a sign of a mode of seeing the world that no longer was in loving
          communion with the Creator.
          Now, Christ comes to reveal the fullness of divine love, to restore a loving marital union to his people.
          Whereas the fig tree hides, Christ reveals.
          The fig tree represents a rebellion against God’s commandments, but Christ inscribes them in our hearts. </p>
        <p>Benedict XVI sums up this vision of Christ’s love in Deus Caritas Est (#17): </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In the gradual unfolding of this encounter, it is clearly revealed that love is not merely a sentiment.
            Sentiments come and go.… It is characteristic of mature love that it calls into play all man's
            potentialities; it engages the whole man. Contact with the visible manifestations of God's love can awaken
            within us a feeling of joy born of the experience of being loved. But this encounter also engages our will
            and our intellect. Acknowledgment of the living God is the one path towards love, and the “yes” of our will
            to his will unites our intellect, will and sentiments in the all- embracing act of love. But this process is
            always open-ended; love is never ‘finished’ and complete; throughout life, it changes and matures, and thus
            remains faithful to itself.… The love-story between God and man consists in the very fact that this
            communion of will increases in a communion of thought and sentiment, and thus our will and God's will
            increasingly coincide: God's will is no longer for me an alien will, something imposed on me from without by
            the commandments, but it is now my own will, based on the realization that God is in fact more deeply
            present to me than I am to myself. Then self- abandonment to God increases and God becomes our joy. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>During Holy Week, rejoice in the love that Christ has for you.
          Invite him into your heart to purify it from all other attachments, that you may abandon yourself completely
          to a loving worship of the Bridegroom.
          May we be transformed.</p>
        <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,
            consider using the <a href="https://app.exodus90.com/main/reader/field-guide-sections/206"

        <hr>
        <h2 id="week-6-action-items">Week 6 Action Items</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Enter into Holy Week fully.</strong>
          Don’t let this be just another week.
          Our prayer discipline calls for a daily holy hour.
          In these final days, set your alarm, get up early, go to the chapel or light a candle beside a crucifix at
          home, and let the Lord change your life as you sit before him in your holy hour. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Consider increasing your fasting.</strong>
          Sprint to the finish line!
          Push yourself in fasting.
          Decrease your food intake or your sleep.
          Now is the time to put it all on the line.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Don't give in to distractions this week.</strong>
          Silence your phone, turn off notifications, deactivate badge icons.
          Do whatever it takes to stay close to Christ, to finish this exercise strongly, to be present to your family,
          and to live as a free man.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Keep moving forward this Easter.</strong>
          If you go back to the way you lived before Lent, you’re likely to slide back and return to the vices you
          struggled with then.
          We need to learn to celebrate well, in a way that expresses our joy in God without losing the discipline that
          we have achieved.
          If you make a plan to celebrate Easter in a disciplined way, you’re more likely to avoid falling back and
          instead will keep moving forward.
          Exodus’s Easter exercise will focus on building a sustainable rule of life, balancing celebration and
          discipline. </p>
        <p><strong>5. Stick with your brothers.</strong>
          You may not know how important your brothers have been to you along this journey.
          Keep investing in one another and building your friendship.
          Talk with your fraternity about keeping things going during Easter.
          Talk about how you plan to feast, reflect, and keep moving forward.</p>

        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And they came again to Jerusalem. … And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one
            another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the first of all?” Jesus
            answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord
            your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’
            The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than
            these.” And the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that he is one, and there
            is no other but he; and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the
            strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and
            sacrifices.” And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom
            of God.” And after that no one dared to ask him any question. And he sat down opposite the treasury, and
            watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. And a poor widow
            came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny. And he called his disciples to him, and said to them,
            “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.
            For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had,
            her whole living.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>On Tuesday of Holy week, Jesus visits the temple for the last time, and from within the temple he declares:
          greater than all burnt offerings and sacrifices is loving God with all your heart, mind, and strength.
          What makes Jesus’ coming sacrifice of infinite value is not merely the suffering and the blood, but rather,
          the intensity and perfection of his love for the Father and his love for all mankind.
          And this act of love is total: he gives himself entirely: body, blood, soul, and divinity.
          There is no more that he can give. </p>
        <p>Christ invites us to reciprocate in love.
          He invites us to hasten to him with the entirety of our being: our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
          As St. Nicholas Cabasilas writes, </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>[Christ] is the resting place of human desires; he is the good of our thoughts. We are to love him alone.
            But that we may turn our love toward him at all times… there is no need of any special formulas for prayers,
            nor need to call upon him from any special place. There is no place in which he is not present; it is
            impossible for him not to be near us. For those who seek him He is actually closer than their very hearts.”
            (Life in Christ, Bk. VI.13)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Our love is not limited to the temple; nor do we have to express it through particular animal sacrifices.
          Rather, at all times, and in all places we are to live in such a way that all of our life is a loving gift of
          self to Christ.
          At times we may not be able to be actively attentive to his love, but we must always make this love the
          fundamental driving force of our lives.</p>
        <p>If we do this, our very life is an expression of heavenly life.
          St. Nicholas continues: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>All that is ours follows the will and moves where it is born by it.… If then, to imitate Christ and to live
            according to him is to live in Christ, this life is the effect of the will when it obeys God’s purposes.…
            What then may life be more fittingly called than love? For that which alone survives and does not allow the
            living to die when all things have been taken away is life—and such is love. When all things have passed
            away in the age to come love remains, and it alone suffices for life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Life in
            Christ, Bk. VII.15)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Today, pray acts of love to God.
          In your prayer, will to love him with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength
          precisely because he alone is God.
          Give your whole self to God with love, for Christ has given his whole self to you with love.<br>Let us be

        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the

        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
          transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in Jerusalem.</strong>

        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the
            scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him; for they said, “Not during the feast, lest
            there be a tumult of the people.” And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at
            table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the jar and
            poured it over his head. But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, “Why was the ointment thus
            wasted? For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor.”
            And they reproached her. But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful
            thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you
            will not always have me. She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying. And
            truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in
            memory of her.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>On this Wednesday of Holy Week, what we also call Spy Wednesday, we are reminded of the order of love: God,
          and God alone, is our first love.
          He has loved us completely and extravagantly, and we are to respond to him in like manner.
          The ointment of the woman was worth 300 denarii, almost a year’s worth of day wages.
          St. John’s Gospel tells us that it was Judas Iscariot who objected to this “waste” of the ointment when the
          money could have been given to the poor, “not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he
          had the money box he used to take what was put into it” (John 12:6).
          Although comparing ancient currencies is difficult, when Judas agrees to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver,
          he is probably accepting no more than half the value of the perfume. </p>
        <p>We cannot allow our love for God to be moderated under the pretext of love for our neighbor; when we do this,
          it will also undermine the love of our neighbor which we profess to be concerned with.
          As Benedict XVI writes: "Practical activity will always be insufficient, unless it visibly expresses a love
          for man, a love nourished by an encounter with Christ” (Deus Caritas Est, #34). </p>
        <p>Our love for Christ is what enlivens our love for our neighbor.
          As Benedict XVI continues:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Faith, hope, and charity go together. Hope is practiced through the virtue of patience, which continues to
            do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's
            mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes
            and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our impatience
            and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that in spite of all darkness he
            ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on
            the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light—and in the end, the only light—that can always illuminate a
            world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able
            to practice it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love and in this way to cause the
            light of God to enter into the world." (Deus Caritas Est, #39)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Today, renew the right ordering of love within yourself.
          We must love others because Christ loves us, and we love him.
          Do not be like the Pharisee who remains impassive even when Christ is present in his home; be transformed by
          charity!
          Do not be like Judas and let selfish greed masquerade as concern for others.
          Be overwhelmed by love for Jesus!
          Anoint him with your love, and allow him to anoint you with his love.
          Unite all of your work, all of your successes and failures to his loving sacrifice of his life.
          Let your love be joined to his, and let that love illuminate even the darkness of the tomb.
          Be transformed.</p>

        <p><em>And when it was evening he came with the Twelve. And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, “Truly, I
            say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.” They began to be sorrowful, and to say to
            him one after another, “Is it I?” He said to them, “It is one of the Twelve, one who is dipping bread into
            the dish with me. For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of
            man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.” And as they were eating,
            he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.” And he
            took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them,
            “This is my blood of the {new} covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly, I say to you, I shall not
            drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.” And when
            they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>We must seek the food that truly satisfies us.
          Benedict XVI tells us, in Deus Caritas Est (#13): </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Jesus anticipated his death and resurrection by giving his disciples, in the bread and wine, his very self,
            his body and blood as the new manna. The ancient world had dimly perceived that man's real food—what truly
            nourishes him as man—is ultimately the Logos, eternal wisdom: this same Logos now truly becomes food for
            us—as love. The Eucharist draws us into Jesus' act of self-oblation. More than just statically receiving the
            incarnate Logos, we enter into the very dynamic of his self-giving. The imagery of marriage between God and
            Israel is now realized in a way previously inconceivable: it had meant standing in God's presence, but now
            it becomes union with God through sharing in Jesus' self-gift, sharing in his body and blood. The
            sacramental “mysticism”, grounded in God's condescension towards us, operates at a radically different level
            and lifts us to far greater heights than anything that any human mystical elevation could ever accomplish.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Eucharist is the bread of charity: it feeds and sustains our love for Christ.
          Each time we receive the Eucharist we should strive to receive Christ with more zeal, more longing, more
          attention than we have done previously, and in this way, our charity will increase.
          Christ gives himself to us in the Eucharist in the measure that we give ourselves to him.
          It is the moment when we surrender to God’s love in response to his incredible self-gift of love and life that
          he offers to us. </p>
        <p>At this moment, we participate in the heavenly banquet; our life here and the life of the world to come meet.
          Jesus Christ is the substance of our eternal life; and our love, which we have received from him, is what lets
          us participate in that substance.
          All else fades in the presence of this reality.</p>
        <p>Christians have been celebrating the Eucharistic feast for two thousand years.
          Allow the Lord to open the eyes of your heart to understand this life-changing mystery.
          Receive the love of God and let it transform you. </p>

        <p><em>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the
            ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why
            hast thou forsaken me?” And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.” And one
            ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let
            us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.” And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last. And
            the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood facing him,
            saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”</em></p>

        <p>Today, love has revealed itself.
          Benedict XVI writes, once again in Deus Caritas Est (#12): </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Jesus’ death on the Cross is the culmination by which God gives himself in order to raise man up and save
            him. This is love in its most radical form. By contemplating the pierced side of Christ we can understand
            that “God is love” (1 John 4:8). It is there that this truth can be contemplated. It is from there that our
            definition of love must begin. In this contemplation the Christian discovers the path along which his life
            and love must move.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Mark’s Gospel, the only person who confesses Jesus to be the Son of God is the centurion who sees Jesus
          breathing his last.
          It is this moment that completes Peter’s first confession that Jesus is the Christ.
          It is the second step in the gift of faith.
          Men knew there was something special about Jesus, but only on the Cross is the fullness of his divinity
          revealed.
          What is St. Mark saying?</p>
        <p>Faith for its fullest expression requires love.
          While we might laugh at the lover who sees wondrous beauty in his beloved, it is perhaps most true that only
          the lover really sees his beloved as she really is.
          All the rest of us are not looking intently enough to see her dignity and worth.
          Jesus reveals himself in love; his last act is to breathe his last, that is, to give forth his Spirit, his
          love. </p>
        <p>The Spirit revealed in faith at his baptism, the Spirit that accompanied him in hope at his transfiguration
          is now may manifest in love.
          In his most extreme agony, Jesus cries out to the Father who had proclaimed him at the beginning of his
          ministry.
          The Trinity revealed at his baptism in prophetic signs is now made manifest for all mankind upon the Cross.
        </p>
        <p>Today, let us contemplate Christ crucified and see in him the fullest presence of divinizing love.
          Be transformed.</p>

        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
          scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
          the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
          transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in Jerusalem.</strong>
          This week, we will focus on the greatest transformation: to love with Christ’s love.
          Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
          of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
            Thy kingdom come.
            Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
            Give us this day our daily bread.
            And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
            And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
            Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
            Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
            took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate wondered if he were already
            dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. And when he learned from the
            centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph. And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him
            down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he
            rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was
            laid. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought
            spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week they went to the
            tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from
            the door of the tomb?” And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; for it was very large. And
            entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were
            amazed. And he said to them, “Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen,
            he is not here; see the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going
            before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.” And they went out and fled from the tomb;
            for trembling and ecstasy had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</em>
        </p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Love calls us out of ourselves.</p>
        <p>Benedict XVI writes: </p>
        <p>Love is indeed ‘ecstasy’, not in the sense of a moment of intoxication, but rather as a journey, an ongoing
          exodus out of the closed inward-looking self towards its liberation through self-giving, and thus towards
          authentic self-discovery and indeed the discovery of God. (Deus Caritas Est, #6) </p>
        <p>Love calls us out of ourselves.
          The love that brought the myrrh-bearing women to the tomb of Christ was transformed into ecstasy when they
          beheld the angel and the empty tomb.
          They may well have experienced what St. John of Dalyatha describes as a step in the prayer life of Christians:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The mind may be transported by the Spirit to an eternal ocean of light, falling into ecstasy, transfigured
            with great joy. Immersed in this light, the mind surges with the action of love and joy … it gazes upon the
            shining angels and there is entrapped and overwhelmed by the vision of glory. (Homily on Theoria) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We come to the tomb today, and wait in loving silence, offering whatever gifts we are able to bring.
          And Christ will transform those meager gifts into an astonishing, ecstatic experience of divine love drawing
          us ever upward. </p>
        <p>The earliest manuscripts of Mark’s Gospel end with this verse anticipating the vision of the risen Lord.
          St. Mark has led us through the transforming, divinizing journey of following Christ, and he leaves us waiting
          to encounter the risen Lord in the light of Easter morning.</p>
        <p>Let us wait.
          Let us love.
          Let us be transformed.</p>

          <h1 id="welcome-to-lent-for-men">Welcome to Lent for Men</h1>
          <p>If this is your first experience of a spiritual exercise from Exodus, welcome!
            We're so glad that you've joined us for this Lent.
            If you've done Exodus 90 or another spiritual exercise with us in the past, welcome back. </p>
          <p>This Lenten exercise is built on three pillars: prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            Through prayer, we learn to listen to the voice of God in our lives.
            Through asceticism (or acts of self-denial), we say "no" to ourselves so we can say "yes" to Christ.
            And through fraternity, we are surrounded by other men who share our desire to live a virtuous life and can
            keep us accountable to keep moving forward toward the Lord.
            These pillars are a roadmap to transformation in Christ, which is the theme of this Lent.
            As we dive into a life of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity through the next 40 days, we will read daily
            from Saint Mark's Gospel.</p>
          <p>Through this Lenten experience, you are entering the broader community of Exodus Men seeking freedom in
            Christ.
            Welcome to the fraternity!
            Each and every day, Exodus Men around the world are united in common prayer for each other.
            This exercise will help you to embrace the very goal of Lent itself: to let go of attachments, to seek
            conversion, to be open to the Lord's work in your life, to make reparation, and to prepare for the new life
            of Easter. </p>
          <hr>
          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings, spending a few minutes of recollection on where you are
            spiritually. Here on Ash Wednesday, what brought you to this Lenten exercise? Where are you in your daily
            life? </p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</strong>
            Lent is a time of penance. We have been made in the image and likeness of God, but we have severed our
            relationship with him and been banished from our true home. As we sit in the wilderness, we call to mind the
            good that we have forfeited by our sins, the relationships we have broken, and the fragility and suffering
            of our lives.
            As we do penance for our sins, fasting intently, consecrating these weeks to the Lord, we hear the voice of
            John the Baptist proclaiming that this penance is necessary to prepare ourselves to encounter the One
            mightier than he. </p>
          <p>And hearing John's voice, we remember how God made us in his image, how we have fallen from that glory, and
            how much we depend on his saving grace to restore us to our original likeness.</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance with the Lord for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p>When the disciples asked Jesus how to pray, he taught them the "Our Father."
            Join your Exodus brothers all over the world in praying this powerful prayer every day for the intentions
            above.</p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
              As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare
              your way; the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths
              straight—"
              John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of
              sins.
              And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were
              baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
              Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and had a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild
              honey.
              And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not
              worthy to stoop down and untie.
              I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>St. Mark begins his account abruptly, announcing that this story will be a "gospel"—an <em>euangelion</em>.
            In the Roman Empire, an <em>euangelion</em> was a message declaring an imperial victory; the emperor had
            conquered, and his subjects could now rejoice in the peace and liberty that he had brought them. </p>
          <p>But St. Mark's Gospel, unlike an imperial proclamation, begins by telling us that while there has been a
            great victory, we first need to remember what we need to be saved from.
            And John the Baptist is the man chosen for that vocation. John appears like a new mighty warrior of God,
            like Samson or the soldiers of ancient Israel, who were fed by wild honey in the wilderness (cf. Judges
            14:8-9; I Samuel 14:24-26).
            But the war John the Baptist fights is one of repentance; he is here to remind all of Judea that they must
            radically repent. John's entire life—his intense fasting, his austere dress, his remote dwelling in the
            wilderness—all of this penance testifies to our radical need to repent.
            We all have sinned.
            We all have fallen into sins that have damaged our relationship with God, our relationship with each other,
            our relationship with ourselves, and our relationship with the world around us.
            John fasts to tame his own bodily desires; he dwells in the wilderness to withdraw from sinful creatures and
            strengthen his relationship with God; he robes himself in animal skins to live in simple poverty.
            Stripping himself of all worldly comforts, he shows the Israelites a complete alienation from all that they
            naturally seek and calls them to seek God and his holiness instead. </p>
          <p>John the Baptist proclaims a double message: wash yourselves in the waters of repentance for your sins, but
            know that it is not enough.
            Begging for forgiveness is only the beginning.
            What we must yearn for is not merely to live a normal human life with less sin; God has placed a deeper
            desire within our hearts to walk with him and to be transformed into his perfect image and likeness.
            This is what we have lost due to sin. This must be the real motive for our repentance. </p>
          <p>St. John also announces the good news of the One who will come after him, One greater than he who will
            transform us by baptizing us into Divine life.
            Our great penance is to prepare us to meet the One who comes after John.
            It is an expression not just of repentance for our sins but, even more, of our longing to be lifted up into
            union with God.</p>
          <p>So let us fast intensely today. Let us withdraw quietly into our hearts, withdrawing especially from
            distracting, superficial relationships, and let us pray with John in repentance for our failings, but even
            more, that we may yearn for a transforming union with God.
            Let us receive our ashes, but may those ashes be a sign not just of sorrow for sin but also of our yearning
            for transforming union with God.</p>
          <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

          <p><strong>Build your Fraternity</strong>.
            As men, we are made for communion, which breaks us out of spiritual isolation.
            Great transformations are not won on our own but happen only with and through others.
            This remains true for making a fruitful Lent.
            We need support, especially as we battle in the desert with Christ.
            Exodus Men who have experienced transformation consistently give abundant credit to the great fraternity
            they built along the way.
            Those who have set time aside for fraternity regularly report how they have become a greater source of grace
            to their families. </p>
          <p>To experience transformation in Christ, you need to commit to fraternity.
            If you don't have a fraternity or your group is smaller than the recommended size (5-7):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's not too late to <a href="https://app.exodus90.com/main/invite" target="_blank">invite men in your
                life</a> to join you on this journey through Lent.
              Prayerfully consider the men you know who could benefit from this journey of transformation and invite
              them.</li>
            <li>If you need help finding a group, head to the <a
                href="https://app.exodus90.com/main/chat/fraternity-finder" target="_blank">Fraternity Finder</a> to
              create or join a remote group.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Within your fraternity, each man should pair up with a brother.
            This particular brother is now your anchor, and you are his.
            If there is an odd number, make it a group of three.
            The two (or three) of you should check in daily.
            This should usually be a brief meeting or phone call, but on a busy day, a text conversation is acceptable.
          </p>
          <p>Commit to living the life the Lord is calling all men to, which includes the commitment to living
            fraternity.
            In addition to staying faithful to your weekly meetings, here are three optional but proven recommendations
            for strengthening your fraternity:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Consider scheduling a weekly fraternity holy hour. Your daily holy hours can be done on your own, but
              coming into the presence of the Lord as a fraternity has a mysterious unifying effect.</li>
            <li>Go to confession regularly as a fraternity. Regular confession every few weeks is a great way to renew
              your brotherly bonds, both with your fraternity and with Christ. </li>
            <li>Attend one extra Mass with your fraternity each week.
              Past Exodus fraternities have found that attending an extra Mass each week worked best when a consistent
              day of the week was chosen. Many fraternities paired their weekly Mass with their fraternity holy hour
              before or after Mass.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</strong>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
              And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon
              him like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
              The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
              And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels
              ministered to him.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>When the Messiah comes to John the Baptist, he asks John to baptize him, to admit him into the ranks of
            repentant sinners. What an awesome and terrifying paradox.
            How can John baptize and instruct the Christ whom John was preparing by penance to welcome?
            How can he share his own life of penance with Christ?</p>
          <p>As Jesus arises out of the water, John the Baptist sees the heavens open and "the Spirit descend as a dove
            from heaven and remain on him (John 1:32), and he hears the voice from heaven proclaiming Jesus as the
            beloved Son of God. John not only learns who Jesus is, he learns that the God whom he has served all his
            life is a Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
            Further still, God the Son is present here to him, being baptized.
            This revelation must have been like an electric shock as John realized that this man before him was God the
            Son.
            What a profound mystical experience! John had shared in Jesus' own vision of the Holy Spirit, and in that
            moment, he also understood why Jesus wanted to be baptized.</p>
          <p>In the Gospel of St. John the Evangelist, John the Baptist explains the reason by saying, "Behold, the Lamb
            of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).
            St. Mark, however, prefers to show the meaning without spelling it out: immediately after baptism, Jesus is
            taken by the Spirit into the wilderness for forty days to be tempted by Satan.
            The message is the same in both Gospels: God has become man to take upon himself our sins and to make our
            penance and struggle his own, not because he owes penance, but because he wants to enter into our penance
            and thereby become the lamb who offers his penance as a sacrifice on our behalf.
            He wants to transform our repentance and fasting and other penitential acts into a means of transforming us
            into himself.
            If we share in Christ's suffering and reparation for sin, then our suffering and penance become signs of our
            closeness to him.
            And when we share that penance with Christ, we, like John the Baptist, will share in Christ's own
            relationship with his Father.
            We will hear the Father tell us that we are beloved in Christ, and we will receive, in Christ, the gift of
            the Anointing that makes him Christ the anointed.
            In other words, we will receive the Holy Spirit through our penitential union with Jesus.</p>
          <p>Jesus shows us today that participating in the disciplines he took upon himself for forty days in the
            wilderness is the first step in allowing him to transform us.
            Let us follow Jesus into the desert of Lent, repenting with him.
            The wilderness of our penance is transformed into a garden of Eden (cf. Isaiah 41:17-20), another place of
            joy because God is with us. Let us joyfully undertake our penance, therefore, knowing that in doing so, we
            are clinging ever closer to our God Incarnate, Jesus Christ. </p>
          <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

          <h2 id="todays-action-item">Today's Action Item</h2>
          <p><strong>Write Your Why</strong>. We all need transformation in Christ. It is important to begin Lent with a
            clear intention of how you need to experience this transformation. Why have you decided to do this spiritual
            exercise? While we all can acknowledge that we have not served God and our families perfectly, it helps to
            have specific goals for growth over these forty days.</p>
          <p>Exodus, including this Lenten exercise, is a movement of God's people from slavery to the promised land.
            What are your particular dependencies and attachments? We can make a potential list: sports, email, mobile
            devices, work, television, videos, video games, food, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, smoking, money, stock
            trading, news, homework, public appearance, power, control, hobbies, gambling, materialism, laziness,
            activism, and narcissism. All too often in our day, men have become enslaved to pornography and
            masturbation. We are all enslaved in different ways, but things can change.</p>
          <p>Lent provides an opportunity, but how will you take advantage of it? Take the time today <a
              href="https://app.exodus90.com/main/tasks/why-statement" target="_blank">to write your why</a>. </p>
          <p>Be honest about those things from which you need to be freed. Be honest with yourself, with your brothers,
            and with the Lord. This honesty is a vital step toward transformation. Offer your why to the Lord in prayer,
            making it a spiritual sacrifice. Remember that the focus is not a negative turning away from things but a
            positive embrace of the Lord and others in love. Love is the most powerful motivation, helping to focus on
            what matters most. If we are embracing Lent for God and to love others more, it will be more powerful than
            simply trying to stop bad habits.</p>

          <p><em>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, "The
              time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel."
              And passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the
              sea; for they were fishermen.
              And Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men."
              And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
              And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zeb′edee and John his brother, who were in their
              boat mending the nets.
              And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zeb′edee in the boat with the hired servants,
              and followed him.
              And they went into Caper′na-um; and immediately on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught.
              And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the
              scribes.
              And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, "What have
              you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?
              Have you come to destroy us?
              I know who you are, the Holy One of God."
              But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
              And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</em> </p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>When Adam and Eve fell from grace in Eden, God gave them both the punishment of painful work: for Eve, God
            declared that she would conceive and bring forth children in toiling pain, and for Adam, God said that in
            toil and sweat he would bring forth bread from the earth (see Genesis 3:16-19).
            The Hebrew word is the same in both cases, <em>iṣṣabon</em>, and both times it implies not only physical
            discomfort and effort but also mental anguish and anxiety.
            It is a sign of the lack of harmony that now exists between man and the wider world: no longer are things
            like eating and bringing forth new life effortless.
            Instead, our life is a constant struggle, a fight for resources, success, recognition, and the rest.
            And it is doomed to failure. The last line of God's punishment reads, "In the [anxious] sweat of your face
            you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust
            you shall return."
            Man's existence is a relentless battle with all aspects of life, and in the end, we will return to the dust
            we were made from.
            Why is man so anxious?
            No matter what he does, he will die. Even if he is successful in some venture, in the end he will still die.
            The author of Ecclesiastes takes this anxious toil as indicative of man's miserably vain condition:
            everything is pointless, because after a life of toil, we've earned only death. </p>
          <p>When Christ emerges from his own victorious struggle with temptation, the first thing he offers to Simon,
            Andrew, James, and John is relief from vain toil.
            He frees them from pointless labor and begins their training for a work they can be confident will endure:
            the work of proclaiming the new kingdom of God and capturing the hearts of men for their King.
            Immediately after he calls these disciples, Jesus enters a synagogue on the sabbath, that blessed day of
            rest from toil, and casts out a demon—the root of man's perpetual restlessness.</p>
          <p>This does not mean that Jesus brings us a life with no effort.
            Certainly not.
            But it does mean that he wants to transform our efforts into meaningful, enduring results.
            Whereas before, effort was always filled with a certain anxious fear because we knew there was a horizon
            that would reveal our work as a vain show, now our pains and anxieties and efforts can be free from
            captivity to the devil and free to serve an eternal King and his kingdom. </p>
          <p>"Repent," Jesus cries, echoing John the Baptist.
            But the repentance is coupled with belief in the good news of his coming victory; the labor of penance and
            of life is no longer a pointless exercise whereby earthly existence is possibly made a little better.
            Now penance is a divine work, undertaken with Christ.
            Let us therefore gladly undertake the work of our repentance, offering up our labors and sacrifices for our
            own sanctification and the sanctification of those we love. </p>

          <p><strong>Embrace Asceticism</strong>.
            Lent is a time of prayer and penance.
            Fridays in Lent are even more intense days when everyone is called to abstain from meat, and we focus our
            attention on the Passion of Christ.
            This exercise should help you to make the most of Lent by embracing asceticism, the practice of penance, and
            self-denial.
            The combination of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity leads to inner conversion through external acts to
            provide you with a framework for growth.
            Each discipline that you embrace this Lent will provide you with an offering to God for your good and for
            your family.
            The suffering of saying "no" to deserts and sweets may be difficult, but if you see that your "no" is really
            a "yes" offered to the Lord, then your mindset will change.
            This comes through uniting your sacrifice to the cross and prayerfully offering the sacrifice to the Lord
            for your specific intention.</p>
          <p>This Lenten exercise contains a <a href="https://app.exodus90.com/main/exercises/exercise/lent"
              target="_blank">specific list of ascetic disciplines</a>.
            As you review the list, you may notice that the disciplines touch most aspects of daily life.
            Some may be easy for you, while others will be more challenging.
            If some disciplines seem unnecessary because you don't struggle with them, commit to doing them anyway.
            If some seem too hard for you to handle, commit to those too. In both situations, the Lord has gifts he
            wants to give you through them as a whole by creating a spirit of docility and humility.
            The practice of asceticism is challenging.
            It is a sacrifice and a cross.
            Take up your cross this Lent and offer your whole life as a worthy sacrifice to the Lord, holding nothing
            back.</p>
          <p>The asceticism of these 40-plus days will prune us of our attachments and help us to focus on what is most
            important.
            It will provide us with a means of growing in inner strength by doing difficult things for the Lord.
            The exercises will provide us a means of making reparation for our sins, helping us to realize that our
            material attachments cannot satisfy us.
            In our dependence upon them, we act as if they could make us happy, but there is no amount of material
            pleasure that could ever bring us peace.
            We must turn to what can truly satisfy us in loving God and others.
            Our culture acts as if suffering should be avoided at all costs, but in making a sacrifice, we deliberately
            suffer for what is most important (as a soldier who suffers for his country).
            Of course, there is always a need for prudence.
            If there is something in your life that makes taking up one of the disciplines reckless or imprudent, don't
            take it up.
            Let your fraternity know of any disciplines you aren't able to practice so that you can live these forty
            days in the light, and your brothers can best hold you accountable.*</p>

          <p>Even before their anxious toil began, Adam and Eve were confronted with another effect of their fall: they
            were immediately alienated from each other.
            Before, they had been completely present to each other, trusting and vulnerable with no shame; now they each
            hid part of themselves, fearful that the other would exploit or harm them, no longer only looking at them
            with love and a desire for mutual self-giving (cf. Gen. 2:25 and 3:7).
            We all know the pain of mutual distrust or actual betrayal and abandonment that has damaged so many of our
            relationships. </p>
          <p>The Psalmist compares this alienation from our friends with the experience of sickness: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of
              my sin… My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand afar off (Psalms
              38:3,11) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>And the more intense the sickness, the more we experience the pain of isolation from our fellows.
            In fact, the anxiety we have about death is, in part, an anxiety about the total rupture of our
            relationships with friends and family: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol [the place of the dead].
              I am reckoned among those who go down to the Pit; I am a man who has no strength, like one forsaken among
              the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave …
              You have caused loved one and friend to shun me; my companions are in darkness. (Psalms 88:3-5, 18) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Whether there is a physical, emotional, or mental sickness, or whether our ailment is in fact the rupturing
            of relationships, we have all known some taste of this isolation. </p>
          <p>But Jesus comes to us in our isolation. Simon's mother-in-law was alone in her bed.
            The others were praying at the synagogue; she could not witness Christ's authority over the demon and the
            power he had to free Israel from slavery to sin.
            But Christ came to the woman in her isolation, raised her from her bed and healed her, and brought her into
            the community of meaningful work. Her house becomes the place where the whole city gathers—relationships are
            being healed.</p>
          <p>Let Christ come into the areas of your life where you suffer from the pain of isolation, into those
            relationships that need to be healed.
            We began the Great Fast by begging for forgiveness of those around us; invite Jesus into that action, and
            ask him to heal all those relationships.
            He has come to free us from the effects of our sins, and that includes the pain of mistrust and suspicion.
            Let his healing begin to transform your love for your neighbors.</p>

          <h2 id="todays-action-item">Today's Action Item</h2>
          <p><strong>Commit to Daily Prayer</strong>.
            Lent is a perfect time to ask yourself, "what is the most important thing in my life?"
            It's a defining question, and nothing answers it more honestly than how we spend our time.
            Lent is a time of spiritual growth that relies on God's grace to enter into Christ's life: his prayer and
            battle in the desert.
            As part of this Lenten exercise, you're called to commit to a daily holy hour.
            How is it going so far?</p>
          <p>Archbishop Fulton Sheen reflects on the importance of a holy hour for change: "It reduces our liability to
            temptation and weakness... The Lord will be favorable even to the weakest of us, if He finds us at His feet
            in adoration, disposing ourselves to receive divine favors... Even the person who has fallen can expect
            reassurance if he watches and prays."
            If you desire transformation, then be committed to your daily time of silent prayer.
            Do not let yourself be persuaded into thinking that you have no time.
            You can do it.
            God will provide the grace for you if you show up to prayer each day, willing to receive it.</p>
          <p>In addition to the scripture and reflection offered by Exodus, the holy hour will be an experience of
            silent meditation and contemplation with the Lord.
            You are called to commit yourself to a daily holy hour, but if you can't do an entire holy hour on a given
            day, do as much as you can.
            Preserving twenty minutes of silent contemplative prayer is the exercise minimum on days you cannot make a
            full holy hour.
            When you are making the full holy hour, at least twenty minutes of silent contemplative prayer in open
            conversational time with God should be a part of the hour.
            Ideally, daily holy hours should be spent in Eucharistic adoration with our Eucharistic Lord exposed in a
            monstrance or reposed in a tabernacle.
            If neither option is available, then "go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in
            secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you" (Matthew 6:6).</p>
          <p>Exodus Men form a living fraternity.
            You can count on the prayers of your brothers.
            They will be praying for you, and you should be praying daily for them by name. Moreover, there are tens of
            thousands of Exodus Men around the world praying for you and for all Exodus Men.
            These are your brothers.
            They have endured the same grueling, purifying ninety days you are about to take up.
            They continue to "fight the good fight of faith" (1 Timothy 6:12) through their ongoing life of prayer,
            asceticism, and fraternity. So be encouraged.
            You and your fraternity are far from alone on this journey.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</strong>
            Remember the glory that God has called you to, how you have fallen from that glory, and how much you depend
            on his saving help.</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he
              prayed. And Simon and those who were with him followed him, and they found him and said to him, "Every one
              is searching for you."
              And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came
              out." And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. And a
              leper came to him begging him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean."
              Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be clean." And
              immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.
              And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at once, and said to him, "See that you say nothing to any
              one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof
              to the people."
              But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer
              openly enter a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Adam and Eve had fallen, and even their relationship to their own bodies was broken.
            Their bodies did what they did not want to do, and in the end, the body would do what they did not want the
            most: the body would die.
            Leprosy, a walking death, was a symbol of that rupture between the soul and body caused by sin, of the
            doomed destiny of each person.
            In leprosy, the flesh decayed and fell off so that his body seemed like a corpse even before he died.
            It was repulsive, and it recalled with unrelenting clarity the final end of all our struggles.
            It raised fear in everyone who saw it because it was the destiny of their bodies as well.
            The leper's cry may very well have been like the cry of St. Paul, "Wretched man that I am!
            Who will deliver me from this body of death" (Romans 7:24)?</p>
          <p>And this dark destiny was the result of Adam's rejection of his purpose.
            His soul was not strong enough to resist the seductive lies of the devil and to simply trust God and bend
            his will to God's commands.
            God made Adam in his own image and established him in his friendship.
            He was to live in submission to God—trusting him, depending upon him, and obeying him.
            But Adam, and every sinner since Adam, has rejected that vocation, and so each of us finds ourselves unable
            to make our bodies and our wills always live and act as we would want.
            We have bodies of death, and not vessels of honor and grace.</p>
          <p>But Christ came to restore this divine life in us.
            He wants to bring us, the walking dead, back to life and reestablish us in his friendship.
            But how?
            By his wonderful plan of love and sacrifice, foreshadowed by the sacrifice that Moses commanded for the cure
            of leprosy.
            For Moses ordered that to be cleansed, a leper must bring two birds to the priest.
            One bird would be sacrificed over running water.
            The living bird would be dipped into the blood of the dead bird and this blood the priest would then
            sprinkle over the leper seven times and pronounce him clean, and the living bird would be set free (see
            Leviticus 14:1-7).
            In order to save the human race, now walking in the leprosy of sin, Christ, in his great compassion,
            willingly sacrificed his life.
            His blood, through the waters of baptism, washes over us and divine life is restored to our souls.<br>Only
            then are we set free to fulfill God's glorious purpose for our lives.</p>
          <p>Christ has come to restore us.
            To be with us.
            To cleanse us by the blood of his suffering and death on the cross offered to his Father to satisfy in his
            own flesh for our sins.
            Let us stir up our gratitude.
            Let us spend time today thanking the Father for his forgiveness, thanking the Son for his love and
            suffering.
            And let us pray that throughout this Lent, we will be ever more renewed in the divine life that he has, at
            such a great cost, restored to us. </p>

          <h2 id="todays-action-item">Today's Action Item</h2>
          <p><strong>Observe Sunday as a Little Easter</strong>.
            Lent is actually forty-six days.
            We speak of forty days in the desert with Christ because we do not count the six Sundays between Ash
            Wednesday and Easter as a part of Lent.
            Every Sunday celebrates the resurrection.
            For this reason, Sunday is not a day of fasting in the Church's tradition, and during this Lenten exercise,
            we have a mitigation of our disciplines.</p>
          <p>The Church's liturgical life draws together an annual cycle of fasting and feasting.
            Lent, of course, focuses primarily on asceticism, but as we grow in discipline, we should be able to enter
            more deeply into true festivity and celebration.
            Without stopping our spiritual exercises, we enter into the joy of holy days and honor them through our
            prayer and, on the most solemn days, by lightening our disciplines. </p>
          <p>Each Sunday is a little Easter on which we remember and celebrate the Lord's Day, the day of the Lord's
            Resurrection.
            Every Sunday, therefore, your fraternity is permitted to relax one discipline together to remind you of the
            glory of God and anticipation of the joy of Easter.
            Choose one discipline to relax as a fraternity to preserve fraternal unity and accountability.
            It is strongly advised that you do not relax technology-related disciplines. </p>
          <p>As we progress in Lent, there are two solemnities (in addition to Sundays) that call for celebration: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Saint Joseph's Day, Patron of Exodus 90, on Monday, March 20th</li>
            <li>The Annunciation of the Lord on Saturday, March 25th</li>
          </ol>
          <p>These days will follow the same principle, allowing for the relaxation of one discipline as set by the
            fraternity.
            Our Lenten asceticism should enable us to enter into the joy of the Lord to express true spiritual joy in
            prayer and leisure. </p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee.</strong>
            We have heard the call of Christ, and we have followed him, leaving worldly pleasures behind us.
            Every step of the way moves us further away from the stability of our previous life.
            As we travel through the countryside with Christ, the terrain is difficult, and we may miss some of our past
            pleasures, but there is a mysterious joy amidst the hardships.
            The source of that joy is in the person of Jesus Christ. He has called us to leave behind our normal life
            and to discover who he is. But this is no easy task.
            There is a mystery about Jesus, but he invites us to continue to ask questions.
            As we seek the answers, we will also come to see that the more we know about who he is, the more we will
            know about who he wants to transform us to be.<br>Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things that
            are not Christ’s.
            He has big things in store for us and desires to purify us ever more.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even about the door;
              and [Jesus] was preaching the word to them.
              And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And when they could not get near him
              because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had made an opening, they let down
              the pallet on which the paralytic lay.
              And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “My son, your sins are forgiven.”
              Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, “Why does this man speak thus? It
              is blasphemy!
              Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
              And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them,
              “Why do you question thus in your hearts?
              Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your pallet
              and walk’?<br>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to
              the paralytic—“I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.”<br>And he rose, and immediately took
              up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We
              never saw anything like this!”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Jesus suddenly presents himself in Galilee with his message of a new kingdom that will deliver us from the
            effects of Adam’s and of our own transgressions.
            This message is revolutionary, never before heard in all its force and grandeur.
            It is a message more experienced than understood; the crowds were amazed as they saw Jesus cast out demons,
            but not because they comprehended his new teaching.
            It was the experience of his absolute authority not limited by any kind of natural law that led people to
            know that this was a new kind of rabbi.</p>
          <p>Beginning in chapter two, Mark leads us through a series of questions that people ask about Jesus.
            In asking these questions ourselves, and in hearing Jesus’ responses, we are drawn ever more deeply to know
            who this new teacher is.
            Today, Jesus offers forgiveness of sins, so that we too may question in our hearts, “Who can forgive sins
            but God alone?” Jesus is truly God.
            The God whom David cried out to for forgiveness in Psalm 51 is the very one who now walks on earth.
            Only God can forgive sins, and therefore God incarnate can save us from our sins.
            No mere creature can pardon an offense against the infinite goodness of God.
            Sin at its core is an act of ingratitude and malice, an attack against the very Source of our being.
            But God is always able to draw forth something from nothing.
            As the catechism teaches: “Since God could create everything out of nothing, he can also, through the Holy
            Spirit, give spiritual life to sinners by creating a pure heart in them” (CCC, #298).
            He reveals his almighty power in the act of forgiving our sins.
            It is the same almighty power that creates everything out of nothing, the same power with which he restores
            health to lifeless limbs, and the same power that creates light out of darkness. </p>
          <p>We do not often think of the immense rupture that our sins create between God and us.
            Nor do we think of the limitless love that induces God to bridge that unbridgeable divide.
            Today, spend some time contemplating that great breach and ponder with gratitude that the good God, whom we
            have so offended, wants to draw us close to him and heal us.
            God has become the Son of Man. We have never seen anything like this.
            Let us pray that we may be overwhelmed by such beauty and goodness, such magnificent grace.</p>
          <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

          <p><strong>1. Face temptations in prayer.</strong>
            The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television, movies, or televised sports while at work, alone
            at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from doing the Lord’s will.
            Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations.
            Stay attentive to God in prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this
            with God.</p>
          <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and relying on
            God daily, and that starts today.

          </p>
          <p><strong>2. Detach through asceticism.</strong>
            Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity to detach and be present to him and others.
            Use your mobile devices only for essential communications so that you can be present to those you love.
            Set your phone out of sight and embrace your freedom.</p>
          <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.”
            It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer him these little sacrifices.
            We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
            Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long.
            Accept the grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others.
            (For more on asceticism and self-offering see <a
              href="https://app.exodus90.com/main/reader/field-guide-sections/603" target="_blank">The Gift of
              Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
          <p><strong>3. Seek Reconciliation with God and others.</strong>
            Penance aims at making things right.
            It acknowledges that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
            attachments and getting rightly ordered to God.
            The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to go to Confession.
            God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also give us the grace that we need
            to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live different. </p>
          <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our relationships.
            As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person for
            forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them. </p>

          <p><em>He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him, and he taught them.
              And as he passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him,
              “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.
              And as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his
              disciples; for there were many who followed him.
              And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said
              to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
              And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who
              are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Why does Jesus eat with sinners?
            Yesterday, Jesus revealed his divinity: he is the omnipotent creator of heaven and earth who can forgive
            sins.
            Today, we see his divine splendor surrounded by many sinners.
            He is God, but the people feasting with him are the poor, the sinners, the wretched.
            Why does God not dwell in a palace?
            Why is he not attended by kings, and served by the wealthiest, and the wisest, and the best?</p>
          <p>In answer to the Pharisees, Jesus could have pointed out how even the very best that humanity could offer
            is infinitely beneath the glory of God.
            He could have laughed at how foolish it is for a Pharisee to think he is holy, for a king to think he is
            mighty, or for a scribe to think he is wise when in the company of omnipotence and omniscience.
            But he did not.</p>
          <p>Instead, Jesus presents to them the fundamental point: why is he here at all?
            The question should be not who is God eating with, but why God is eating on earth?
            Or walking on earth? What could possibly explain the infinite, eternal Being walking the earth in a weak,
            human body?<br>And the answer Jesus gives is: I have come to heal the sick; to forgive sins, to restore what
            is broken.
            The reason God is on earth as a man is to act as the Divine physician, to call and spiritually heal mankind.
            Man is spiritually broken, alienated from his own being, from his fellow men, from his God.
            And God has come to heal that brokenness.</p>
          <p>Moreover, he has come to heal this fatal wound of man by entering into his nature.
            St. Athanasius is clear on this point: if God wanted to merely forgive sins, he could do so by decree.
            But God wants to do more. He wants to be one of us—to share our humanity and teach us how to share his
            divinity—healing us from the inside out. </p>
          <p>Of course, Jesus cannot make sin itself to be something that is not alienating from God.
            That is why he shows us how to resist temptations when he answers the devil in the desert.
            That is why he calls Levi away from his sinful practices.
            But once the sinner has responded with contrition and penance, as John the Baptist called all to do, then
            Jesus can heal the devastating effects of sin. He can come to the mess and brokenness created by our sins
            which we cannot fix, no matter how much we may want to, and he can fill that brokenness with his healing
            presence.</p>
          <p>Spend time today reflecting on your own life.
            Where are the areas left broken by your sins? And then invite Jesus into those areas to transform them.</p>

          <p><em>Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, “Why do John’s
              disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
              And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?
              As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
              The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
              No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new
              from the old, and a worse tear is made.
              And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is
              lost, and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Why don’t your disciples fast? This seems like an odd question to us in the midst of our Lenten fast.
            Very clearly, the disciples of Jesus do fast, and at times exhaustingly so! It is all the more surprising to
            hear Jesus say that not only are his disciples not fasting, they cannot do so.
            But he promises that the time will come when they will fast.</p>
          <p>What are we to make of this?
            First, Jesus is using fasting as a further way to reveal himself.
            He is not only God become Son of man who has entered into our humanity, he is also our Bridegroom.
            He does not leave us broken and sad, but has come to fill us with joy as at a wedding celebration.
            The fast of John the Baptist and the Pharisees stressed their sinfulness, their waiting for the coming of
            the Savior who would reunite God and man. Christians need not participate in this fast.
            That would be putting new wine into old wine skins.
            Christians are not longing for the coming of a Redeemer; instead, Christians are proclaiming that their
            Beloved is here with them, and his presence fills them with joy.</p>
          <p>When Christians fast, therefore, we are always joyfully aware of the presence of our Redeemer. For this
            reason, we must “anoint your head and wash your face” (Matthew 6:17) and be content even when fasting.
            Our penance is no longer a sign of God’s absence, but it is a sign that we are journeying with our
            Bridegroom.
            What joy!</p>
          <p>And yet, the Bridegroom is not fully present to us.
            This is not because he is far away, but rather, because our love is weak.
            Our Bridegroom is present in our souls through our love, and when our love is weak, it is as if he were far
            away, even though he is in reality more present to us than we are to ourselves.
            Therefore, we fast so we may grow in love, so that the God-Man may ever more be present in our souls and we
            may experience more fully the happiness of his presence. </p>
          <p>We are wedded to Christ. He cannot be taken from us, although we ourselves can abandon him. So let us turn
            today with all of our powers of attention and cleave to him.
            Let us invite him into our fasting so that he might break down whatever attachments keep us away from him.
            And let us affirm with joy that God becoming man has joined us to him forever.</p>

          <p><em>One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to
              pluck ears of grain.
              And the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”
              And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those
              who were with him: how he entered the house of God, when Abi′athar was high priest, and ate the bread of
              the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were
              with him?”<br>And he said to them, “The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; so the Son of
              man is lord even of the sabbath.”
              Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
              And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And
              he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come here.”
              And he said to them, “Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?” But
              they were silent.
              And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, “Stretch
              out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
              The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with the Hero′dians against him, how to destroy
              him.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>“Why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?” </p>
          <p>Throughout this week, Jesus has been revealing himself as the God-Man present in our pain, who transforms
            our pain into joy with his presence.
            But we need to be careful and not assume that we cannot feel pain, or sadness, or other “negative” emotions
            because as good Christians we should always be happy.
            Why are Jesus and his disciples plucking grain and eating it on the sabbath?
            Because they are hungry.
            They are poor.
            They are exhausted.
            Jesus himself really feels those things.
            Yes, he is God, but he is also man. And as man he finds himself tired and hungry on the day of rest.</p>
          <p>The sabbath was instituted by God as a day when all mankind could rest from their toil and focus on the
            worship of the Lord. God-made-man entered into our fallen condition, and he and his followers were in need
            of food on the sabbath day like King David and the soldiers with him who were on a mission and could not
            stop to worship at the ark of the covenant (see 1 Samuel 21:1-7). David was worshipping God by fulfilling
            his will, and God, through the sign of the showbread, was present to him in his need and hunger.</p>
          <p>As man, Jesus toils.
            As God, he gives rest. And he does this at one and the same moment.
            His divine rest enters into our anxious toil and becomes a real experience of his divine presence.
            This is not a contradiction.
            God’s presence is life-giving; and whenever we are receiving God’s life, we are entering into his rest.
            It is always lawful for God to feed and heal on the sabbath because the sabbath was made for man to be with
            God.
            We can experience both the toil of our God-given duties and God’s rest in that toil because both are present
            simultaneously in Jesus.</p>
          <p>In fasting we also find both toil and rest.
            As we fast we may feel hungry, weak, stressed, tired, overwhelmed, and we may come face-to-face with our own
            sinfulness.
            This is toil. But God fills our toil with his restorative love.
            Even as we fast, we find healing. We keep praying. We repent. And when we repent, God comes to fill us with
            his loving-kindness.
            He is there to remind us that he was hungry too, and that he has transformed the experience of hunger to be
            an encounter with divine mercy.</p>
          <p>So in your time of prayer today, present to Christ your withered hand, the brokenness you are discovering
            in your penance.
            And ask him to give you his rest as you continue to toil.</p>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p>*Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat. And when his
            friends heard it, they went out to seize him, for they said, “He is beside himself.”
            And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beel′zebul, and by the prince of
            demons he casts out the demons.”
            And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?
            If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<br>And if a house is divided against
            itself, that house will not be able to stand.
            And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.
            But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; then
            indeed he may plunder his house. *</p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>When Jesus’ friends see him casting out demons, what do they see?
            They see a man surrounded by a throbbing, yelling, perhaps partially deranged crowd. He cannot eat. He
            cannot sleep.
            He is surrounded, and apparently in such a state of pain and exhaustion that his friends say, “He is beside
            himself, out of his mind.”
            And his enemies look at him and they assume that he is possessed by a demon; in some ways he looks like the
            very ones he is saving.</p>
          <p>Jesus turns from the crowd in response to the accusation.
            He immediately comes to himself and shows that he is in his right mind; whatever he looks like, whatever he
            feels, he is always in control of himself. He is breaking into the strong man’s house, to the human
            experience of toil and fear, and he is setting humanity free.
            Satan is the strong man; he holds mankind captive through their fear of death, their anxiety, their
            pointless labor.
            And Jesus comes into that house, but he comes not as a prisoner (as his friends thought), not as a captor
            (as the scribes claimed), but as a liberator. </p>
          <p>He invites us to join him in a new mode of living. He invites us to experience the toil of Adam not as a
            demonic chain, but as a sanctifying work, a work that makes present God’s redeeming power.
            On our own we cannot transform our work, as a convict cannot change his prison sentence.
            But Jesus, who has no sin, can take on the toil of Adam and make it a liberating event.
            And once we are liberated, we can share in his work.</p>
          <p>Today let us contemplate the face of Jesus as he appears to his friends and the scribes.
            But let us see that face with more understanding than they did.
            Let us see his pain, his anxiety, and his toil. And let us keep looking until we see his love for us.
            And let us contemplate that face all through this penitential Friday.</p>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>“Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;
              but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—
              for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.“</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Who then is Jesus?
            Who is the man who experiences the effects of sin, without sinning, and what is more, who transforms his
            sufferings into redemptive moments? He must be a singular man, a person capable of suffering and redeeming
            in one and the same moment.
            This is the classic theological formulation that the Christian tradition has developed to express the
            mystery of Christ: he is one Person, a single unitary subject, but one who is fully God and fully man. When
            we ask who is acting, the answer is always, God the Word.
            However, the fact that God the Word is the subject does not mean he is not fully human. He acts in
            everything he does, in everything he suffers as both God and man. As God he is redeeming our human
            experience at the very same moment, he is suffering the experience in his human nature.
            There are not two different subjects cooperating together, but rather, one subject acting both divinely and
            humanly.</p>
          <p>St. Maximos the Confessor explains this using the image of a fiery sword: the sword will both cut and burn
            in one and the same motion, having two different principles of action.
            So too with Christ: when he acts or suffers, there will always be both a fully divine action and a fully
            human action.
            To claim that Christ is only human, or only God, or partially both, is to obscure the profound miracle of
            the Holy Spirit and to deny the only path for the redemption of mankind.
            There is no salvation except through the truth of who Jesus Christ is.</p>
          <p>We must, then, bow down and worship Jesus Christ, true God and true man.
            His picture is God’s picture, his touch, truly a divine touch.
            We worship God in a body. His human nature came to us in time, but it will forever continue united to the
            second Person of the Holy Trinity.
            This is an extraordinarily profound mystery, a truth that transcends the limits of our mind. </p>
          <p>The Catechism quotes a prayer that the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom uses to express this mystery: "O
            only-begotten Son and Word of God, immortal being, you who deigned for our salvation to become incarnate of
            the holy Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, you who without change became man and were crucified, O Christ
            our God, you who by your death have crushed death, you who are one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the
            Father and the Holy Spirit, save us!" (CCC, 469).</p>
          <p>Let us worship Jesus, true God and true man, who opens to us the way of our Lenten journey. </p>

          <p><em>And his mother and his brethren came; and standing outside they sent to him and called him. And a crowd
              was sitting about him; and they said to him, “Your mother and your brethren are outside, asking for you.”
              And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brethren?” And looking around on those who sat about him, he
              said, “Here are my mother and my brethren! Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and
              mother.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>We are the mother and brothers of Jesus.
            After all we have seen this week—the mystery of his divinity, the mystery of his humanity, the profound
            unity of his two natures in one divine Person, his redemptive preaching and healing—how can we possibly
            speak of such a one as being our brother, our son?
            Yet it is precisely with this claim that St. Mark ends his question-and-answer search into the mystery of
            who Jesus is.
            What does this mean? </p>
          <p>Our Lord says that whoever does the will of God is his mother and his brother. St. Paul writes, “This is
            the will of God, your sanctification” (I Thessalonians 4:3).
            When we are made holy by God, we are fulfilling his will. And when we are made holy, Christ is again present
            in the world through our action.
            Our hands become his hands, our words, his words.<br>“For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of
            God … you have received the spirit of sonship ... we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs
            of God and fellow heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:14-17).
            We are brothers of Christ because our sanctification makes us into sons of the Father.</p>
          <p>This is the profound message of the Gospel: Christ by taking what is ours, has given to us what is his.
            By taking on our human nature through his birth of a pure, human mother, he has given us his divine nature
            to make men into the sons of God.
            St. Paul adds one caveat, however. We are fellow heirs with Christ “provided we suffer with him in order
            that we may also be glorified with him” (Romans 8:17).
            Christ invites us to fully imitate him in his humanity, which is to invite us to make his suffering our own
            suffering, just as he has made our suffering his own suffering. </p>
          <p>Let us follow Jesus to his Cross, journeying through the rest of this Lent to the Paschal Mystery, and let
            us pray that we may love him more fully as our son and our brother.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            We are now two weeks into our journey and we are surrounded by the wilderness of Galilee. Like the
            disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the daily
            weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to renew ourselves
            by entering into Christ’s prayer and making it our own.</p>
          <p>Jesus has revealed to us the mystery of who he is, and who he wants us to be. He has led us to detach
            ourselves from things that give us comfort so as to better cling to him. Now he invites us to go deeper, to
            enter the sacred silence that is his own prayer—to share in his own longing for our sanctification and a
            share in his communion with the Father—and this prayer will radically transform us. Come, brothers, let us
            be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into
              a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land. And he taught them
              many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he
              sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. Other seed fell on rocky ground,
              where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; and when the sun
              rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away. Other seed fell among thorns and the
              thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. And other seeds fell into good soil and brought
              forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.” And he
              said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Jesus both sows the seed, is the seed, and receives the seed. This is the marvelous mystery of Jesus
            Christ, true God and true man. As God, he reveals himself to mankind. And as God the Word he is the word
            sent from the Father into the hearts of all believers. He is God’s own revelation of himself, and he himself
            is the fullness of God’s revelation. And as man, Jesus must receive the gift of revelation.
            This last point takes a little to grasp. God, in his divine nature, has a divine mind. In his divine mind he
            knows himself and all that he is going to do. But in addition to his divine mind, the Second Person of the
            Trinity assumed a human mind when he assumed a human nature. As the Catechism states,
            “This human soul that the Son of God assumed is endowed with a true human knowledge. As such, this knowledge
            could not in itself be unlimited: it was exercised in the historical conditions of his existence in space
            and time. This is why the Son of God could, when he became man, “increase in wisdom and in stature, and in
            favor with God and man," and would even have to inquire for himself about what one in the human condition
            can learn only from experience” (CCC, 472).
            But the human mind of Christ was not cut off from his divine mind by a wall of separation. As the Catechism
            explains,
            This truly human knowledge of God's Son expressed the divine life of his person. "The human nature of God's
            Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and showed forth in itself everything that pertains
            to God." Such is first of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son of God made
            man has of his Father. The Son in his human knowledge also showed the divine penetration he had into the
            secret thoughts of human hearts. By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word incarnate,
            Christ enjoyed in his human knowledge the fullness of understanding of the eternal plans he had come to
            reveal. (CCC, 473-474)
            Jesus’ human mind, however, only shared in the divine knowledge through the gift of revelation. The human
            mind of its own cannot know the Father, or the Father’s eternal plans, or the secret thoughts of other
            hearts. All this knowledge only comes as a gift of revelation. Therefore, Jesus, in his divine nature
            reveals and is God’s Word, but in his human nature he receives this gift of revelation. He receives this
            revelation not for his own sake, but to share it with us.
            Today spend time in prayer asking Jesus to share his word with you. Ask him to help you hear it and let it
            take root in your mind just as it took root in his. He came so that we could share in his knowledge of God.
            Ask him for that gift.</p>

          <h2 id="week-2-action-items">Week 2 Action Items</h2>
          <p><strong>1. Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</strong>
            In our prayer, fasting, and giving we are seeking to be like Christ.
            We can speak about imitating him, but this is more than copying.
            When we enter our holy hour, we enter into Christ’s own prayer and become interiorly conformed to him,
            joined to his own love for the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            In our sacrifices, we are not just giving things up to be tough.
            We are learning to love like Christ, putting the Father before all else.
            Be both the one who offers the sacrifice for others and the sacrifice itself.</p>
          <p>Everything we give up is ordered toward relationship with God.
            We make sacrifices to spend time with those who are important to us.
            Get up earlier, give up your lunch break, do what it takes to make time for God.
            Stay focused on the goal of union with God in all that we do this Lent. </p>
          <p><strong>2. Give up in order to give.</strong>
            Giving alms is a pillar of Lent for a reason.
            Nothing material in this world can completely satisfy a man.
            God gives us good things not to please us but to use for the good of others.
            Lent is a season of increased almsgiving, of greater attention to those in need.
            Make sacrifices for God and he will satisfy you.
            If you sacrifice unnecessary spending, you will be able to give more to others. </p>
          <p><strong>3. Be a well set anchor.</strong>
            The Christian life is made up of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            If you live prayer and asceticism, but not fraternity, you’re doing something, but you’re not living the
            fullness of the Christian life.
            Lean in and build a bond with your brothers.</p>
          <p>A key part of fraternity is being a good anchor.
            Stay honest with your anchor on how you are doing every day.
            Call him on to be honest and regular in his check-ins with you as well.
            Be a dependable, well set anchor.</p>

          <p><em>And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables. And
              he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything
              is in parables; so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest
              they should turn again, and be forgiven.” And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How
              then will you understand all the parables? The sower sows the word. And these are the ones along the path,
              where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in
              them. And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the word,
              immediately receive it with joy; and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when
              tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. And others are the
              ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world, and the delight in
              riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. But those
              that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold
              and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>If Christ needed the gift of revelation for his human nature, he also needed the gift of grace so that his
            human nature could cooperate fully with his divine nature.
            There is no natural human aptitude to act like God, or to work miracles, but in the Incarnation, Jesus
            needed, in the words of St. Cyril of Alexandria, to accomplish human things divinely.
            This gift of grace whereby the human and divine were in complete conformity is a consequence of the personal
            union of God the Word with his human nature, enabling Jesus to fittingly live out the fullness of his
            Incarnate life. </p>
          <p>That is all very intellectual and heady, but this speculative truth has profound consequences for our
            lives.<br>St. John writes in his Gospel: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.
            . . . And from his fulness have we all received, grace upon grace” (John 1:14,16).
            St. Thomas Aquinas explains this passage by noting, “Grace was received by the soul of Christ in the highest
            way; and therefore from this pre-eminence of grace which he received, it is from him that this grace is
            bestowed on others. . . . Hence the personal grace, whereby the soul of Christ is justified, is essentially
            the same as his grace that justifies others.”
            In short, St. John and St. Thomas both present the vision of Christ as the source of grace for us as if the
            fullness of his anointing from the Holy Spirit flowed down from the head of the Church to fill us, his
            Mystical Body, as well.
            And this reality is the fullness of Christian prayer.</p>
          <p>By participating in the grace of Christ, we participate in Christ himself.
            That is why in his explanation of the parable, Jesus blends the lines between us and him, noting both that
            “the sower sows the word” and that “those [seeds] that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear
            the word and accept it and bear fruit.”
            Those who receive the word are the ones who are sown and participate in the mystery, the grace, and the
            being of our Lord through the experience of transforming prayer from which good fruit springs forth.</p>
          <p>Today meditate on the planting of Christ’s grace within your soul.
            Pray that his grace may take root and bear abundant fruit.
            But this fruit requires good soil, that is, a nourishing life of prayer.
            Ask Christ to teach you to pray as he wants you to pray throughout this week.</p>

          <p><em>And he said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on a
              stand? For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to
              light. If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” And he said to them, “Take heed what you hear; the
              measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you. For to him who has will
              more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>St. John of Damascus writes: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Just as iron plunged in fire does not become fire by nature, but by union and burning and participation,
              so what is deified does not become God by nature, but by participation.
              I am not speaking of the flesh of the incarnate Son of God; for that is called God immutably by personal
              union and participation in the divine nature. . . . By deification the saints are gods, it is said, that
              ‘God stands in the company of the gods.’</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>God stands in the company of the gods; that is, he is with deified souls who participate in the grace of
            Christ through prayer.
            The more we grow in prayer, the more we grow in sharing in the sonship and grace of Jesus Christ.
            But this blazing fire of grace needs to be kindled, and it is kindled by God in proportion to the measure we
            open ourselves to him: “the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you.
            "For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
            We must be clear: we do nothing to earn his grace; it is freely given.
            But to the extent or measure we commit to regular prayer, to standing before God present in our hearts, with
            that measure God will generously bestow himself into us.
            But to the extent that we neglect the divine spark of sanctifying grace within us, to that extent our
            negligence will finally cause even that spark to be extinguished. </p>
          <p>We can begin by offering daily vocal prayer to God—either prayers that we create, or prayers received from
            scripture and tradition—and we may do this privately or with others.
            In whatever way we do it, we must always be attentive to what we are saying; our minds must mean the words
            we pray, and we must mean them as our own words, words arising from our own desires.
            We must be attentive to the fact that we are speaking to God within our hearts, even as we use our mouths to
            make the sounds. </p>
          <p>As we undertake this vocal prayer, let us remind ourselves that we stand before the awesome God, and that
            we are sinful creatures who he has condescended to save.
            Yet, we should also call to mind his extravagant gratuitous love for us; he has planted the light of his
            grace in our hearts.
            In vocal prayer we submerge ourselves in that light, entering into its hidden depths and allowing our tongue
            to declare, our eyes to see, and our ears to hear his presence within us.</p>
          <p>Today, stand before God.
            Be attentive to him who dwells within you, and as you say your vocal prayer aloud, shining the light of

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the
            daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to enter the
            sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and communion with
            the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And he said, “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground, and should sleep
              and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how. The earth produces of
              itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. But when the grain is ripe, at once
              he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>The second degree of prayer is mediative.
            Using the word degree here should not imply that vocal prayer is left behind; rather in our prayer we may go
            back and forth between the various degrees, as did Jesus himself.
            We see Jesus praying vocally in the synagogue, and then we see him leading us into meditative prayer through
            his parables.
            And we are told that he went into the wilderness, where he was immersed in prayer and the angels ministered
            to him (Mark 1:13,35), which we can assume refers to contemplative prayer.
            We too can move back and forth between these degrees, and sometimes the degrees interpenetrate each other so
            that in our conversing with God we use both vocal and meditative prayer.
            Each psalm of scripture is the fruit of meditation upon the word of God, which can then lead us into vocal
            prayers and inspire further meditation.</p>
          <p>So profound is the experience of prayer, that in a way, we can see prayer as an experience of the kingdom
            of God.
            It brings us before God’s presence and transforms us into citizens of that kingdom.
            God’s word, present on the page, is illuminated by meditation and carried into our heart.
            We are called to meditate on it day and night (Psalms. 1:2), turning it over in our minds, ruminating upon
            it, and allowing it to imprint itself upon our hearts.
            As we repeat the words to ourselves, and reflect upon their meaning, the light of the Holy Spirit enables us
            to understand what God wants to reveal to us. </p>
          <p>In meditation we can start with the smallest seed, a short verse of scripture, and as we turn it over in
            our minds, the meaning becomes clearer.
            What before was an obscure phrase now can take root in our hearts and can stretch into our daily lives so
            that we can see now how God wants us to act in a particular situation. </p>
          <p>Today, therefore, take a short reading from scripture, either today’s selection or some other, and focus on
            just a short verse or phrase.
            Repeat it several times to yourself, and sit quietly reflecting upon its deeper meaning, asking God to help
            you understand what he is saying to you.
            Meditate on it day and night, letting it sink deeply into your heart, and it will grow into you in ways you
            cannot explain.
            In this way, the seed of God will grow and ripen, and we will have a harvest to return to him, the Sower of
            the seed. </p>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? It is
              like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;
              yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so
              that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.” With many such parables he spoke the word to them,
              as they were able to hear it; he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own
              disciples he explained everything.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>A great teacher of prayer of the 20th century, Matthew the Poor, writes, “Very few people spend any time
            practicing being with God. Fewer still enjoy the great blessing, by God’s grace, of interior prayer.
            Interior prayer is the fruit of the spiritual life.
            It is a return of Adam to the beauty of his former spirituality.”
            As with vocal prayer and meditation, there is no clear-cut boundary between meditation and the interior
            prayer of contemplation.
            One easily and naturally grows into the other.
            Indeed, the early monks who wrote about the habit of prayerful reading of scripture called <em>lectio
              divina</em> recommended a clear progression: begin by reading a scriptural passage. Before reading, say a
            brief vocal prayer to invite the Spirit into your time of prayer, and then read the passage slowly and
            meditatively.
            At some point you may be prompted to pray various vocal prayers in response to the passage.
            Then, after you consider the words during your time of meditation, make sure to allow for a time to just sit
            with God in silence, or, if not in complete silence, to slowly repeat a word or word of prayer over and
            over, perhaps just the name of Jesus or “Jesus have mercy on me.”</p>
          <p>In this silent, or nearly silent phase, allow yourself to be present with God.
            The divine presence will grow imperceptibly within you until all of your thoughts and feelings take shelter
            within it, as a bird nesting in the shade of a mustard shrub.
            It may not happen every time you sit down for prayer, but this invitation to contemplation is always
            available. </p>
          <p>God is present within our hearts, but for most of our experience, this presence is imperceptible.
            As St. Augustine puts it:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>You were within, and I without, and there did I seek You; I, unlovely, rushed heedlessly among the things
              of beauty You made.
              You were with me, but I was not with You.
              Those things kept me far from You, which, unless they were in You, were not.
              You called, and cried aloud, and forced open my deafness.
              You gleamed and shine, and chase away my blindness.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>As we turn inward, we will discover Love itself awaiting us with open arms.</p>
          <p>We need to realize that this incredible outpouring of the experience of God is not just for the rare mystic
            or the exceptionally holy hermit.
            This experience of God hidden within us that can pervade our internal life is the kingdom of God, a kingdom
            opened to each of us by our baptism. </p>
          <p>Take time today, therefore, to sit in silence, or even to just repeat the name of Jesus, turning all your
            attention to the previously unnoticed mustard seed of his divine presence that God wishes to grow within
            your soul.</p>

          <p><em>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.” And leaving
              the crowd, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. And a
              great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he
              was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care if
              we perish?” And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” And the wind
              ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?” And they
              were filled with awe, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?”</em>

          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Our discussion of Christ’s grace and the various degrees of prayer may give the impression that praying
            with and in Christ is something that we do only in quiet retreat from daily life.
            And certainly, Jesus stresses in his parables that we must turn inward, we must encounter God hidden within
            us, the seed of grace with its transformative power implanted by our baptism and desirous of growing into
            the mature fruit of sanctity. </p>
          <p>But in relating his deeply interior parables so full of meaning, Jesus reminds us that he brought his grace
            into the midst of our anxious toil so that sharing in his prayer, he might transform our daily lives.
            Our days are filled with waves, with ever-changing situations that make us feel that there is no solid
            ground.
            Our jobs, our errands and chores, our relationships, our financial worries—all of these can overwhelm us and
            choke out that spark of divine prayer.
            The multitude of howling forces outside us compel our attention and endanger our peace. </p>
          <p>But Jesus tells us that even in the midst of those experiences, we must fill our hearts with prayer.
            We must cry out to him—not in doubt that he loves us—but with confident faith that he will take care of us.
            The grace of prayer to Jesus is meant to be practiced even in our darkest moments, and when done with faith,
            it will bring us interior peace in the midst of the storm. </p>
          <p>We must not be too busy or too stressed for prayer, but instead, we must let prayer permeate our business
            and our worries.
            We can and should have a daily time of scheduled prayer, but we must also be willing to make short, quiet
            prayers to Jesus throughout the day. </p>
          <p>Jesus is within us, and when storms rage around us, we must waken the Master so he can save us by calming
            the wind and the sea.
            Today, turn to Jesus during your busiest moments, and ever so briefly, rejoice in his loving presence.</p>

            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the
            daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to enter the
            sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and communion with
            the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-pauls-letter-to-the-philippians">A Reading from Paul's Letter to the Philippians</h1>
          <p><em>Have this mind among yourselves, which was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did
              not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,
              being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient
              unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which
              is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the
              earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>It is the third Sunday of Lent, practically the half-way point.
            Make this next week an occasion to redouble your efforts to live out an intense asceticism as you did during
            the first week.
            But before that intensification, today is meant to be an oasis, a day of rest and refreshment, in the midst
            of a hard journey.
            We have spent a week reflecting on the wonder of praying with and in Christ’s own prayer.
            But today, we take a brief break from reading the Gospel of Mark and turn to St. Paul’s hymn of praise to
            Jesus.
            This hymn is clearly the fruit of St. Paul’s own meditative and contemplative encounters with our Lord, and
            St. Paul invites all “in heaven and on earth and under the earth” to join in his hymn of praise as well as
            the prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>We are to put on the mind of Christ in prayer, praying as the Son of God himself prayed in his human
            nature.
            He humbled himself to take the form of a slave, submitting to join a limited, time-bound, fragile and
            tiny-nature to his own omnipotence.
            He further humbled himself when he obediently submitted to death, even crucifixion—death in a most
            humiliating and painful manner.
            And why?
            So that his prayer and submission to his Father in the midst of his pain and anguish on the Cross might show
            us how to transform even the moment when we too perish.</p>
          <p>In his great love for us, he not only made himself a sacrificial victim for our sins, he gave us the
            perfect example of a beautiful death that we might imitate him in his prayer and communion with God during
            our own deaths.
            Jesus’ divinity and unfathomable love shines through even the tragedy of the Cross.</p>
          <p>Pray with St. Paul today that you may acquire the mind of Christ, that you may pour yourself out in love,
            and fill that pouring out with prayer as Jesus did.
            Before fasting or almsgiving, before any other great penitential work, pray that Christ will fill your mind
            with prayer.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            As we continue to journey with Christ through the Gospel of Mark, we find ourselves across the sea in the
            land of the Gentiles.
            It is a godless land, filled with demonic whispering, the fear of death, slavery, animal-like savagery, and
            unclean desires.
            It is the darkest part of our own heart, buried in sin and alienated from God.
            It is the land of our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride.
            As we have fasted and prayed we have acknowledged our own sins and weaknesses.
            Jesus knows our weaknesses and greatly desires to save us from them.
            He tells us that when we are confronted with our selfish pride, we must humble ourselves and pray for his
            help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving. Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.
              And when Jesus had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, who
              lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, even with a chain; for he had often been bound
              with fetters and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the fetters he broke in pieces; and no one
              had the strength to subdue him.
              Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and bruising himself with
              stones.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Last week we considered how Jesus knows the truth in two ways: he knows reality with his divine intellect,
            and he knows it with his human intellect.
            Similarly, Jesus has two wills: a divine will and a human will.
            This means, therefore, that Jesus loves us divinely and humanly.
            All humans also love in a two-fold way.
            We love by an act of the will so that we desire goodness for another in the way that we desire goodness for
            ourselves.
            For example, when a father loves his son, he wants what is best for his son, so much so that he is willing
            to sacrifice himself for his son’s good precisely because his love has made his son’s good his own good.
            This love of the will is done in light of the immortality of our souls; it transcends the limits of our
            merely bodily desires.</p>
          <p>But there is another way we love.
            Love in this sense is in our emotions and is tied to our bodies: we get butterflies in the stomach, we
            flush, our heart beats faster.
            This emotional love is love too, and often there is a back and forth between the love of our wills and the
            love of our emotions: sometimes emotional love moves our wills to love, and sometimes our wills stir up our
            emotions. </p>
          <p>When Jesus loves, he loves in a three-fold way.
            Pope Pius XII explains this: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The physical heart of Jesus Christ, united to the divine Person of the Word, beat with love and with the
              other emotions but these, joined to a human will full of divine charity and to the infinite love itself
              which the Son shares with the Father and the Holy Spirit, were in such complete unity and agreement that
              never among these three loves was there any contradiction or disharmony. . . . The Heart of the Incarnate
              Word is the chief sign and symbol of that threefold love with which the divine Redeemer unceasingly loves
              his Father and all mankind. (Haurietis Aquas, #41, 54)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>When Jesus loves us, he loves us as he has from all eternity as God. He also loves us with his grace-filled
            human will, and he loves us physically with his emotions.
            As St. Maximus of Turin writes, “in Christ our own flesh loves us.”<br>When Jesus comes to heal our pain,
            therefore, he does not come dispassionately.
            He arrives at the tombs and sees the man with an unclean spirit, crying out and bruising himself.
            And he feels deep compassion for him, and also for us, bound as we are by our sins and suffering.
            His divine love expresses itself in human will and in a physical heartbeat. </p>
          <p>As we think about almsgiving this week, let us remember the deeply personal love that should motivate such
            gifts.
            Spend today meditating on Jesus’ threefold love, and rejoice that you are loved so well.</p>

          <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
          <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
          <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
          <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
          </p>
          <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
          <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and prostrated before him; and crying out with a loud voice, he
              said, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment
              me.” For he had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!” And Jesus asked him, “What is your
              name?” He replied, “My name is Legion; for we are many.” And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of
              the country. Now a great herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him, “Send us to
              the swine, let us enter them.” So he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the
              swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were
              drowned in the sea.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>The Catechism states:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In its various forms—material deprivation, unjust oppression, physical and psychological illness and
              death—human misery is the obvious sign of the inherited condition of frailty and need for salvation in
              which man finds himself as a consequence of original sin. This misery elicited the compassion of Christ
              the Savior, who willingly took it upon himself and identified himself with the least of his brethren.
              Hence, those who are oppressed by poverty are the object of a preferential love on the part of the Church
              which, since her origin and in spite of the failings of many of her members, has not ceased to work for
              their relief, defense, and liberation through numerous works of charity which remain indispensable always
              and everywhere. (CCC, #2448)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Jesus’ threefold love is not merely sentimental; it is redemptive.
            It liberates us, defends us, and gives us relief from our suffering.
            Jesus’ divine love makes him present in our temporal pain, and then his human love, joined to that divine
            love, transforms our pain into an occasion of communion with him.
            We are called to love others as Jesus loves us in our actions such as almsgiving or other works of mercy.
            As the Catechism notes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual
              and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are
              forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the
              hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the
              dead. Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity: it is
              also a work of justice pleasing to God. (CCC, #2447)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Our prayerful union with Christ expresses itself in our imitation of him.
            To put on the mind of Christ is to be willing to pour oneself out as Christ did as a merciful gift to those
            in need. </p>
          <p>Today, reflect on the ways that Jesus has come to you in your pain and relieved you.
            And then consider how you can concretely extend that mercy to others in need around you. </p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble ourselves
            and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>The herdsmen fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that
              had happened. And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind,
              the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told what had happened to
              the demoniac and to the swine. And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their neighborhood. And as he
              was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with
              him. But he refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done
              for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decap′olis how
              much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Christ gives himself generously to everyone.
            He gives the greatest gift—the gift of becoming eternally like him.
            And he gives without measure, making the greatest personal sacrifice.
            As we try to imitate Christ’s merciful works, we can think of how to imitate Christ’s love in each of those
            actions. </p>
          <p>First, we can think of what we should give.
            Money?
            Kind thoughts?
            A smile?
            Those gifts have their proper place and time.
            However, all our gifts need to be rooted fundamentally in the gift of Christ to others.<br>This does not
            mean that we need to stand on a street corner and yell out the Gospel at the top of our lungs; it means that
            we should not be afraid to tell others the most important news in the world, that Jesus loves them and wants
            to make them like himself. </p>
          <p>As Jesus shows us in the Gospel today, responding to someone’s pain and need, motivated by the love of
            Christ, will communicate the mystery of Jesus.
            This can be terrifying, as people even fled from the wondrous power of Christ’s love.
            They needed someone to make them understand the benevolence of that power, to witness to the healing of
            Jesus’ powerful love.
            Jesus does not let the man who had been miserably possessed by demons come with him.
            Instead, he sends him to give witness to others. </p>
          <p>We also need to be witnesses.
            We will reflect on the ways to respond to the material needs of others later this week, but we always need
            to remember that our material gifts are for the sake of sharing the Gospel.</p>
          <p>Today, ask Jesus to tell you how he wants you to respond to his mercy.
            In what way is he saying to you, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for
            you.”
            Whom should you tell?
            How do you communicate the Gospel with the kind of love that will make others wonder and desire to know more
            instead of fleeing away in fear or anger? </p>

          <p><em>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him; and
              he was beside the sea. Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he
              fell at his feet, and besought him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay
              your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.” And he went with him. And a great crowd
              followed him and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,
              and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but
              rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched
              his garment. For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well.” And immediately the
              hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus, perceiving in
              himself that power had gone forth from him, immediately turned about in the crowd, and said, “Who touched
              my garments?” And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, ‘Who
              touched me?’” And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing what had been done to
              her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. And he said to
              her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>We receive so much mail from organizations asking for our help and see the same kinds of requests on our
            screens, and we rightly ask, “How do I know whom to help?’
            And Jesus’ answer today is, “Help those right in front of you.”
            We must begin giving alms to the people we encounter in our daily lives.
            Jesus’ teaching was interrupted by the begging Jairus; his garment was secretly touched by the hemorrhaging
            woman; and he immediately responded to both. </p>
          <p>Often we develop habits of ignoring those in need, so the first thing we need to do is to develop an
            awareness of the needy.
            While there may be a good reason not to give money directly to a panhandler, there is never a reason to
            completely ignore the human dignity of someone in need.
            A humane encounter, a look in the eyes, or a smile for a poor homeless beggar might be the best gift of
            their day.
            As Mother Teresa notes, “Many people talk about the homeless, but few talk to them.”</p>
          <p>Of course, prudence is always required.
            One should not go into dark alleys looking for someone in need.
            But we can all do more than we are currently doing.
            As we develop habits of compassionate attention, people will feel comfortable asking us for aid.
            While now we may think there is no one who needs my assistance, practicing Christ-like habits of noticing
            others will likely reveal how many truly are in need.</p>
          <p>We can also be prepared to be better givers: with gift certificates to restaurants, distributable snacks,
            or even dollar bills will make us responsive to those in need.
            The money we save by avoiding big purchases or observing a stricter fast should be used to make us more
            available as givers.
            As you walk down the street, put down your phone and strive to notice who may need your help. </p>

          <p><em>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler’s house some who said, “Your daughter is dead.
              Why trouble the Teacher any further?” But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the
              synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.” And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and
              John the brother of James. When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and
              people weeping and wailing loudly. And when he had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a tumult and
              weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside, and took
              the child’s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. Taking her by
              the hand he said to her, “Talitha cumi”; which means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise.” And immediately
              the girl got up and walked; for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were overcome with
              amazement. And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something
              to eat.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>The crowds laughed at Jesus because they did not believe in his generosity.
            We may imagine that our generosity will be respected, appreciated, and praised.
            But that is not always the case.
            Almsgiving can spark jealousy, accusations, suspicions, and fears, either among those who witness our
            giving, or even among those who benefit from it.
            Our fallen human nature with its mean, ungrateful, and base inclinations can turn against a benefactor even
            in moments when we should be grateful.</p>
          <p>So, we must be ready to suffer when we give alms.
            Sometimes the suffering will come from the pain of parting with some of our goods.
            St. Basil noted long ago that the moment we have a possession, we form an intense attachment to it almost as
            if it were a part of us.
            The first pain of almsgiving, therefore, may well be just the parting with the possession.
            At other times, the almsgiving itself may be an occasion of ridicule as we share the Gospel, or are seen
            associating with a disreputable person.
            Our Lord’s acts of kindness to Samaritans and sinners were often occasions for criticism. </p>
          <p>Our almsgiving may also be the gift of ourselves, our willingness to lay down our life or to suffer in our
            flesh for the sake of saving our neighbor.
            We must be ready and willing to lay down our life if it will save someone from eternal damnation.
            And there are many other ways whereby we may sacrifice ourselves in works of mercy.<br>The Second Vatican
            Council teaches: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“The Lord Jesus implied a certain likeness between the union of the divine Persons, and the unity of
              God's sons in truth and charity. This likeness reveals that man, who is the only creature on earth which
              God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.” (Gaudium et
              Spes, #24) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In the end, all of our almsgiving is to be a sincere gift of self.
            That is what gives it its value.
            If we give sacrificially, it reflects the proper meaning of the gift and helps further our union with our
            Lord. </p>
          <p>Today, ask our Lord to show you how to give alms as an expression of your sincere gift of self.</p>

          <p><em>And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over
              the unclean spirits. He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag,
              no money in their belts; but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. And he said to them, “Where you
              enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. And if any place will not receive you and they refuse
              to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.” So
              they went out and preached that men should repent. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil
              many that were sick and healed them.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Our Lord gave himself to all mankind.
            We are more limited in our capacity for self-giving, and what is more, a general desire to do something good
            for humanity may lead us to neglect the people right in front of us.
            That’s what is so marvelous about the way that Jesus gives himself to us.
            As Pope Pius XII notes: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The knowledge and love of our Divine Redeemer, of which we were the object from the first moment of His
              Incarnation, exceed all the human intellect can hope to grasp. For hardly was He conceived in the womb of
              the Mother of God, when [through his own vision of God] all the members of His Mystical Body were
              continually and unceasingly present to Him, and He embraced them with His redeeming love. O marvelous
              condescension of divine love for us! O inestimable dispensation of boundless charity! In the crib, on the
              Cross, in the unending glory of the Father, Christ has all the members of the Church present before Him
              and united to Him in a much clearer and more loving manner than that of a mother who clasps her child to
              her breast, or than that with which a man knows and loves himself. (Mystici Corporis, #75) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Jesus, in his human nature, was given the grace to know God as God exists in himself.
            Of course, this vision did not extend to the entirety of the infinite divine essence (no created intellect
            can do that), but Jesus, in his human intellect did have a direct perception of God, and, through that
            perception, a miraculous perception of each of us.
            Jesus loves all mankind, but he loves all by loving each particularly, not as some abstraction or generality
            that does not take into account our individuality. </p>
          <p>As we discern how to imitate the expansiveness of Jesus’ almsgiving, we must keep in mind the particular
            way that Jesus gives.
            The more we are attentive to a particular human’s needs, to the individuality of the person involved, the
            more we are giving the way Christ gives. Certainly, the more people we can help the better, but it is not
            the larger numbers that matters as much as our love that is attentive to the particular individual and his
            needs. </p>
          <p>Today, think of at least one person that you can give alms to in this manner, imitating the way Jesus
            loves.
            Then ask yourself whether you can extend that kind of love to at least two more people as well.
            Push yourself as far as you can to give as personally as possible to as many as possible.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for

          <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble ourselves
            and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season

          <p><em>The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. And he said to them,
              “Come away by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they
              had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves. Now many saw
              them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them. As
              he landed he saw a great throng, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a
              shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and
              said, “This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late; send them away, to go into the country and
              villages round about and buy themselves something to eat.” But he answered them, “You give them something
              to eat.” And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to
              them to eat?” And he said to them, “How many loaves have you? Go and see.” And when they had found out,
              they said, “Five, and two fish.” Then he commanded them all to sit down by companies upon the green grass.
              So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. And taking the five loaves and the two fish he
              looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before the
              people; and he divided the two fish among them all. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up
              twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. And those who ate the loaves were five thousand
              men.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Oftentimes we think of almsgiving as something done from our abundance, from what we have in excess, and
            there is something very true about that.
            St. John Chrysostom notes that when we have more than we need, “Not to enable the poor to share in our goods
            is to steal from them and deprive them of life. The goods we possess are not ours, but theirs.”
            If I am throwing away food because I have too much while my neighbor is starving, it is not generosity that
            demands I give him food, but justice.</p>
          <p>Mother Teresa tells the story of a starving woman to whom she gave a bag of rice.
            This woman immediately poured out half the rice and gave it to her neighbor who was also starving.
            This is superlative almsgiving: giving from your need to others who have no claim to your gift.
            This is the almsgiving of our Lord.</p>
          <p>Jesus and his disciples do not have enough food for themselves; five loaves and two fish are barely enough
            to feed thirteen men for a day.
            Yet Jesus commands them to give from their lack, from their poverty, and he multiplies that gift to more
            than satisfy the hunger of five thousand men.
            If we want Christ to use us, we must empty ourselves of our pride.
            We must never give alms because we are so good or important.
            If we put on the mind of Christ, his personal love for others, he fills us and pours out himself through us.
          </p>
          <p>This is the most amazing part of almsgiving: in the end we are not giving from our own abundance of love
            for Jesus, or out of our own holiness.
            We are not giving of ourselves because we ourselves are such a precious gift.
            We give of ourselves so that there is nothing to interfere with Jesus giving himself to others through us.
          </p>
          <p>Today, let us humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord.
            Let us put on the mind of Christ, empty ourselves of our pride, and ask him to make us channels of his grace
            to those in need.</p>

            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            As we continue to follow Christ, we find ourselves constantly going back and forth in our relationship with
            God.
            At times, we find ourselves in a familiar setting, relating to the God we know, resting in traditions and
            customs that comfort and console us.
            At other times we are confronted by something new and challenging: we begin to understand our faults and
            failings anew, and are challenged to grow in new ways. God wants us in this borderland.
            It is where Jesus kept his disciples as he prepared them to encounter his Paschal Mystery.
            And so we follow the disciples and Christ, at times journeying through the familiar areas of Judea,
            repeating the customs of Lent that we expect, and at other times, we set out into pagan lands to discover
            our need for renewed conversion.
            In this back and forth, we need to stay focused on Christ.
            Until now we have been thinking of the works we are doing to be transformed: prayer, fasting, and
            almsgiving.
            Now we want to turn our attention to the activities we can do that are a sharing in Christ’s inner life.
            Jesus wants us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>Now when the Pharisees gathered together to him, with some of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
              they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands defiled, that is, unwashed. For the Pharisees, and all
              the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they
              come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they purify themselves; and there are many other
              traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pots and vessels of bronze. And the Pharisees and
              the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat
              with hands defiled?” And he said to them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,
              ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me,
              teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’ You leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition
              of men.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>The story in today’s reading is almost comical: Jesus has just miraculously fed 5,000 men, with twelve
            baskets of food left over.
            And the only thing that the Pharisees can say is, you didn’t wash your hands before you ate.
            What incredible blindness!
            What a willful refusal to acknowledge what has happened right before their eyes!</p>
          <p>Here we see an hypocrisy that is an obstacle to true faith.
            The Pharisees had received the commandments of God that they were to meditate upon day and night.
            The people of the Mosaic covenant accepted the law because it was revealed by God who is truth itself.
            But for this faith is to be living and active, the people needed to understand what had been revealed.
            The Pharisees were well-known experts in the law and held themselves to be more scrupulous in keeping the
            law. </p>
          <p>But at some point in the history of the Jewish people, many of the Pharisees lost sight of God and his
            loving will and began to delight more in themselves and their own prestige and power to create legal
            traditions among the Jews.
            Washing of hands is a case in point: nowhere in the law does God specify that all Jews must ritually wash
            before eating.
            The Pharisees, however, had extended the priestly requirement to eat in ritual purity to all of Israel as a
            way of demonstrating the link between all eating and eating in connection with Temple worship. </p>
          <p>Those Pharisees who had developed this aspect of the law were delighted by themselves and their own power.
            If their faith had been rooted in humble obedience to God, they would have been able to recognize Jesus as
            the Son of God and marvel at his teaching and miracles.
            But because their faith had become more about themselves than about God, they were unable to respond to the
            revelation of Christ.</p>
          <p>As we submit to our disciplines and rules of life, we must always remember that those external actions are
            not a replacement for the love of God and obedience to the will of God.
            Pope Francis writes, “Believing means entrusting oneself to a merciful love... which sustains and directs
            our lives.... Faith consists in the willingness to let ourselves be constantly transformed and renewed by
            God’s call” (Lumen Fidei, #13).
            The personal, intimate relationship with God that he has given us is the essence of our faith.
            We must always keep in mind that it is God who sustains our life of faith and not merely our own thoughts
            and efforts. </p>

          <p><strong>1. Embrace silence.</strong>
            God brings about our transformation through prayer.
            We need to prioritize silent time with him each day.
            Missing prayer time can seem just like passing by a gas station exit on the highway.
            It's passed before we even realize it.
            If you want to become a holier man, put on the brakes to make time for the source of all grace and life:
            Jesus Christ. </p>
          <p>The disciplines don’t mean much if our hearts and minds aren’t being led in the right direction in silent
            prayer.
            Let the Word of God lead you through this desert each day.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Be diligent.</strong>
            Stay the course by trading desserts for spiritual diligence.
            Keep up all your efforts to the end.
            Christ has great things in mind for you. </p>
          <p>As you continue to maintain discipline through penance and exercise, be sure not to waste the opportunity
            to offer these difficulties for your past sins.
            Embrace this opportunity, this time of renewal. </p>
          <p><strong>3. Stay faithful to your brothers.</strong>
            They need you and you need them regardless of whether or not everyone in your fraternity believes this.
            Show up to your weekly fraternity meeting, be truthful, and let God do the rest. </p>

            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            Christ is preparing us to encounter him in his Paschal Mystery in Jerusalem.
            Jesus invites us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And he called the people to him again, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand: there is
              nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are
              what defile him.” And when he had entered the house, and left the people, his disciples asked him about
              the parable. And he said to them, “Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever
              goes into a man from outside cannot defile him, since it enters, not his heart but his stomach, and so
              passes on?” And he said, “What comes out of a man is what defiles a man. For from within, out of the heart
              of man, come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit,
              licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile
              a man.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>If the thoughts that come out of our hearts are what defile us, we need to be cleansed from the inside out.
            While the words of faith are proclaimed to us from outside, our reception of faith in the silence of our
            hearts is the beginning of our true transformation.
            In other words, Christ’s proclamation is not merely to an external faith.
            As Pope Francis writes in Lumen Fidei (#18):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Christ is not simply the one in whom we believe, the supreme manifestation of God’s love; he is also the
              one with whom we are united precisely in order to believe.
              Faith does not merely gaze at Jesus, but sees things as Jesus himself sees them, with his own eyes: it is
              a participation in his way of seeing.... Jesus, the Son of God, is the one who makes God known to us (cf.
              John 1:18).
              Christ’s life, his way of knowing the Father and living in complete and constant relationship with him,
              opens up new and inviting vistas for human experience.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Faith is not simply a habit of thought; rather it is learning to share in Jesus’ way of seeing as we learn
            to submit our will to his.
            Faith is, therefore, a matter of mind and will at the deepest core of our being.
            We must assent assent to God’s will, and in that very act, we unite ourselves to his view of the world.
            In heaven, that view will be clear, but, while still in this world, we must keep submitting ourselves to God
            and his will as he reveals it to us. </p>
          <p>This internal transformation will affect the way we reason, the way we speak, the way we act.
            We must strive more and more to see the world as Christ sees it and to do the will of our Father as Jesus
            has taught us.
            Our Lord wants to lead us to eternal life.
            This habit of seeing is strengthened by practice.
            The more frequently we make acts of faith, the more frequently we will turn our wills to Christ and the more
            penetratingly we will share in his vision. </p>
          <p>Today, renew your act of faith in God.
            Recall that God is a Trinity, and that the Word became flesh to save us from our sins.
            Then will to believe these mysteries that God has revealed.
            Believe for no other reason than that he himself has revealed them, he who is truth itself.
            And then ask God to let this faith animate all aspects of your life.</p>

          <p><em>And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and
              would not have any one know it; yet he could not be hid. But immediately a woman, whose little daughter
              was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell down at his feet. Now the woman was a
              Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. And he said to
              her, “Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the
              dogs.” But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” And
              he said to her, “For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.” And she went
              home, and found the child lying in bed, and the demon gone.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Pope Francis writes in Lumen Fidei (#19):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In accepting the gift of faith, believers become a new creation; they receive a new being; as God’s
              children, they are now ‘sons in the Son.’ The phrase ‘Abba, Father,’ so characteristic of Jesus’ own
              experience, now becomes the core of the Christian experience (cf. Romans 8:15). The life of faith, as a
              filial existence, is the acknowledgment of a primordial and radical gift which upholds our lives.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Faith makes us sons of God.
            Faith is our entrance into the supernatural life, a life that exceeds the limits of simple human activity.
            Faith is not a feeling, or a deliberate acceptance of ignorance.
            Faith is a sharing in the God-Man’s own way of knowing God and all of his creation.
            We can have that marvelous vision not through any natural ability in us, but through God’s gift of the light
            of faith within our hearts.
            Through that gift received in Baptism, he has become our Father by grace; he has generated us into a new,
            higher mode of life, a life proper to sons of God, learning from and imitating the only-begotten Son of God
            Incarnate. </p>
          <p>The Syrophoenician woman came to Jesus knowing only dimly who he was.
            Jesus presented her with an obstacle—her status as an outsider—to see if she would persevere, if she would
            reject any natural or pagan explanation for Christ’s power.
            Could she recognize that Jesus, as the God of Israel, was the one and only God?
            In the moment when the woman acknowledges that the children of Israel are the true children of God and then
            humbly asks him to have mercy on her who is outside of that covenant, in that very moment the woman herself
            becomes a child of God through faith. </p>
          <p>True faith expresses itself in perseverance through doubt, difficulty, and obscurity.
            It remains committed to prayer and the disciplines undertaken.
            As the woman beseeching Christ demonstrates, faith perseveres even when it seems as though God is ignoring
            or challenging us.
            In those moments we can make clear to ourselves and to God that our faith is his supernatural gift that
            generates a new life in Christ and our personal dependence upon God because we know that he is truth and
            goodness itself. </p>
          <p>Today, pray to God in the full confidence that your faith makes you his son.
            Pray the “Our Father,” and make every petition a request in faith to the Father who has given you a new life
            as his son. </p>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the
              region of the Decapolis. And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech;
              and they besought him to lay his hand upon him. And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put
              his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and
              said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he
              spoke plainly. And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more zealously they
              proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well; he even
              makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>After healing the Syrophoenician woman’s daughter, Jesus comes to her native land, the land associated with
            Baal in the Old Testament and with Greek apostasy in the New Testament.<br>He finds there a man who has
            never heard the words of Moses; he has never encountered the revelation of God in any way.
            He is not just deaf and dumb physically, as he is also unaware of the revealed Word of God. </p>
          <p>Jesus could have revealed himself secretly in the stillness of the man’s heart.
            Faith is indeed an interior reality as we have seen this week, but faith also measures our interior thoughts
            against an objective measurement.
            If faith were only an emotional, subjective disposition to God, there would be no need for external
            teaching, no need for a written book of Scripture or apostolic teachers.
            But God knows that in our brokenness we are too often willing to convince ourselves that our feelings are
            the inspiration of God; our misunderstandings and broken desires we may justify as signs of the divine will.
          </p>
          <p>We need Jesus not only to join himself to us interiorly, but also to provide us with a sure norm that we
            can follow and measure ourselves against.
            For this reason, the teachings of faith are written in Scripture and set forth in fixed clear terms by
            Church councils and wise teachers.
            As the Catechism of the Catholic Church notes: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>We do not believe in formulas, but in those realities they express, which faith allows us to touch. ‘The
              believer's act [of faith] does not terminate in the propositions, but in the realities [which they
              express].’
              All the same, we do approach these realities with the help of formulations of the faith which permit us to
              express the faith and to hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to assimilate and live on it more and
              more. (CCC, #170)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This is why when Jesus heals the deaf man in the way he does.
            He reaches inside of him and enters into his affliction so as to plant the life of faith within his heart.
            At the same time, he opens his ears to be able to hear the external guides and teachings that will help his
            faith to grow, and he heals his tongue, making the man capable of expressing and embodying the interior life
            of faith he now receives. </p>
          <p>Today, spend a few minutes giving thanks to God for the external teachers of the faith that he has put into
            your life, and pray for the grace to respond well to their teaching.</p>
          <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his
              disciples to him, and said to them, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now
              three days, and have nothing to eat; and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the
              way; and some of them have come a long way.” And his disciples answered him, “How can one feed these men
              with bread here in the desert?” And he asked them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, “Seven.” And he
              commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he
              broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.
              And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before
              them. And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.
              And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away; and immediately he got into the boat
              with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanu′tha. The Pharisees came and began to argue with
              him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why
              does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.” And he
              left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Jesus works the miracle of the loaves and fish a second time, this time in the land of the Gentiles.
            In the land of the twelve tribes of Israel, he fed the multitudes with twelve baskets left over as a sign of
            his messianic restoration of the kingdom of Israel.
            Now he feeds the four thousand and has seven baskets left over.
            Seven is the number that recalls creation, for it was in seven days that God created the heavens and the
            earth.
            In feeding the Gentiles, Jesus is promising not only to restore Israel, but to restore all mankind to the
            glory for which it was destined at the beginning. </p>
          <p>Letting us see creation with the eyes of faith is part of that restoration.
            When Adam laid his eyes upon the newly created world he knew first and foremost that each thing brought to
            him was a gift from God intended to help Adam express his inner relationship with God.
            Adam’s loving relationship with God was itself an experience of truth that opened his eyes to see in union
            with his beloved Lord. </p>
          <p>Christ, in the days after restoring hearing to the pagan man, now restores the Gentiles to a communion with
            him—inviting them to eat with him and share in his life and vision, and inviting them into a new covenant of
            mutual faithfulness to each other. </p>
          <p>Pope Francis writes: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Because faith-knowledge is linked to the covenant with a faithful God who enters into a relationship of
              love with man and speaks his word to him, the Bible presents it as a form of hearing … Knowledge linked to
              a word is always personal knowledge; it recognizes the voice of the one speaking, opens up to that person
              in freedom and follows him or her in obedience. Paul could thus speak of the ‘obedience of faith’ (cf.
              Romans 1:5; 16:26). Faith is also a knowledge bound to the passage of time, for words take time to be
              pronounced, and it is a knowledge assimilated only along a journey of discipleship. The experience of
              hearing can thus help to bring out more clearly the bond between knowledge and love. (Lumen Fidei, #29)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Pharisees, lacking a loving relationship, are blind to the obvious signs that God is working in Jesus
            Christ.
            They ask him for a sign, and Jesus sighs deeply and refuses to give them another sign, knowing that they are
            unwilling to see and believe. </p>
          <p>In our Lenten journey, Christ invites us to fast, pray and give alms, so that we can learn to deny
            ourselves and strengthen our spiritual communion with him.
            He also asks us to receive his sacred body given to us in Word and sacrament, so he can nourish our loving
            union with him.
            Let us hear him as Adam heard God speak in the garden.
            Today, pray for an increase in faith that you may render more loving obedience as you strive to better
            express your faith in your daily life. </p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            Christ is preparing us to encounter him in his Paschal Mystery in Jerusalem.
            Jesus invites us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. And he
              cautioned them, saying, “Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” And
              they discussed it with one another, saying, “We have no bread.” And being aware of it, Jesus said to them,
              “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your
              hearts hardened? Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?
              When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take
              up?” They said to him, “Twelve.” “And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken
              pieces did you take up?” And they said to him, “Seven.” And he said to them, “Do you not yet
              understand?”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>When we have an experience, we generally reflect on it.
            That’s what humans do.
            We may reflect more or less well, and we may or may not learn the right lessons, but experience always
            teaches us something when we think about what happens to us.
            When Christ became man, he chose to learn by experience.
            He knew all things from eternity in his divine mind, and his human mind received the fullness of that
            revelation from God; but he also still grew in wisdom by learning things experientially.
            When the hemorrhaging woman touched him, he asked who had touched him so he could experience physically
            seeing her whose faith he knew interiorly.
            So it should be no surprise that Jesus expects us to reflect upon our own experience of faith.
            And when we do that, we are engaging in theology: faith seeking further understanding.</p>
          <p>Pope Francis writes: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Faith... draws us into itself, inviting us... better to know the object of our love. Christian theology
              is born of this desire. Clearly, theology… is part of the very process of faith, which seeks an ever
              deeper understanding of God’s self-disclosure culminating in Christ. It follows that theology is more than
              simply an effort of human reason to analyze and understand, along the lines of the experimental sciences.
              God cannot be reduced to an object. He is a subject who makes himself known and perceived in an
              interpersonal relationship. Right faith orients reason to open itself to the light which comes from God,
              so that reason, guided by love of the truth, can come to a deeper knowledge of God... [This] is a
              participation in God’s own knowledge of himself. It is not just our discourse about God, but first and
              foremost the acceptance and the pursuit of a deeper understanding of the word which God speaks to us, the
              word which God speaks about himself, for he is an eternal dialogue of communion, and he allows us to enter
              into this dialogue.... [We need] humility to be ‘touched’ by God, admitting [our] own limitations before
              the mystery, while striving to investigate the inexhaustible riches of this mystery. (Lumen Fidei, #36)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>When we reflect on our experience of faith, we may do it badly.
            We may, like the Pharisees, come to rely more on our own thoughts and desires than on the foundations of
            faith, or we may, like the disciples in the boat, interpret our experiences in terms of merely earthly
            realities.
            Christ revealed his plan of divinizing redemption, and the disciples could only think about where to get
            more bread.
            So too, we can overshadow the light of faith by our earthly cares.
            During Lent, therefore, we try to think less about eating food and gaining money, and instead empty
            ourselves to receive spiritual gifts.</p>
          <p>Spend time today reflecting on your experience of faith so far during this Lent.
            Ask the Holy Spirit to help you hear what Christ is trying to tell you.</p>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And they came to Bethsa′ida. And some people brought to him a blind man, and begged him to touch him.
              And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes
              and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, “Do you see anything?” And he looked up and said, “I see men;
              but they look like trees, walking.” Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and
              was restored, and saw everything clearly. And he sent him away to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the
              village.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>After returning to Galilee, Jesus gives sight to a blind, Jewish man.
            Here is a man who knows the revelation of the Old Covenant; he knows what God has done for his people.
            But he is a man who has lost his sight: he remembers what trees and men look like, but he has lost his
            vision.
            He does not see the point of his life now, or how all his suffering and toil are a part of God’s plan.
            He does not yet perceive God’s plan to redeem us and make us partakers of his divinity. </p>
          <p>There are two stages to how the blind man is brought to see the face of Christ: first he sees imperfectly,
            as if he sees that Christ is not like the other men around.
            He sees “trees walking”; that is, he sees a man acting well beyond the capacity of any man.
            But he does not yet clearly see who Jesus is.
            Indeed, for Mark, we cannot fully see that until we are able to gaze upon Christ crucified.
            Only then can we fully know who he is.
            And so the blind man is brought through two healings: first to perceive the miracles and wonders of Jesus,
            and then, when he looks more intently, to see into the depths more clearly.</p>
          <p>So too for us: we must look not only to the “highs” of our faith journey: the experiences of joy and
            confidence.
            We must accustom ourselves to look more intently to recognize Jesus in our struggles and sufferings.
            This happens when we allow Jesus to touch our hearts.
            As Pope Francis writes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The light of love is born when our hearts are touched and we open ourselves to the interior presence of
              the beloved, who enables us to recognize his mystery.
              Thus we can understand why, together with hearing and seeing, Saint John can speak of faith as touch, as
              he says in his First Letter: ‘What we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes and touched with our
              hands, concerning the word of life’ (1 John 1:1). By his taking flesh and coming among us, Jesus has
              touched us, and through the sacraments he continues to touch us even today; transforming our hearts, he
              unceasingly enables us to acknowledge and acclaim him as the Son of God. In faith, we can touch him and
              receive the power of his grace. To touch him with our hearts: that is what it means to believe. (Lumen
              Fidei, #31)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>A crowd brings the blind man to Jesus, but it seems none of them touch Jesus with personal faith, a faith
            that apprehends the mystery that he is the Son who reveals the Father.
            Jesus must lead the blind man away out of the village, and touching him, molds the man to himself, so that
            he may receive the faith needed to see and understand who Jesus is.</p>
          <p>Today, on this Fifth Sunday of Lent ask Jesus to touch you in his Sacrament of Love, and to deepen your
            gaze of faith so that you may see ever more clearly who Jesus is and who he wants to transform you to be.

          <p><strong>You are journeying to Jerusalem.</strong>
            This is the final leg of the journey.
            Beginning this week, we are leaving Galilee and making straight for Jerusalem.
            We are looking at the heart of discipleship: transformation in Christ.
            We disciples take on the very life of our master by the gift of the Holy Spirit.
            Christ lives his life anew in us.
            This is why we are considering the three aspects of the inner life of Christ as it is lived by us.
            Last week we focused on faith: the invitation to become sons by putting on the mind of Christ and seeing him
            and the world through his eyes.
            This week we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and which gives us the
            strength to journey with him, even to the sufferings of the Cross.
            Let’s tighten our belts, set our wills, and keep our eyes fixed on our beloved Lord who has pioneered the
            way for us.
            Easter and new life are coming.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end. Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his
              disciples, “Who do men say that I am?” And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and
              others one of the prophets.” And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You
              are the Christ.” And he charged them to tell no one about him. And he began to teach them that the Son of
              man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be
              killed, and after three days rise again. And he said this plainly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke
              him. But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are
              not on the side of God, but of men.” And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to
              them, “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For
              whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will
              save it. For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? For what can a man
              give in return for his life? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful
              generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the
              holy angels.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>We are not only called to share Christ’s vision of God and the world—we are called to make things happen.
            As Benedict XVI notes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Gospel is not merely a communication of things that can be known—it is one that makes things happen
              and is life-changing. The dark door of time, of the future, has been thrown open. The one who has hope
              lives differently; the one who hopes has been granted the gift of a new life. (Spe Salvi, #2)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The gift of faith is an encounter with the living God, and that encounter is life-changing.
            Pope Benedict continues: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Jesus, who himself died on the Cross, brought something totally different: an encounter with the Lord of
              all lords, an encounter with the living God and thus an encounter with a hope stronger than the sufferings
              of slavery, a hope which therefore transformed life and the world from within. (Spe Salvi, #4)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This encounter of faith needs to penetrate even into an encounter with Christ crucified.
            Peter, in today’s reading, sees Jesus as the Messiah, the promised, chosen Christ of God.
            But Peter will have to encounter Christ betrayed, killed, and risen, to encounter the Lord who by his own
            suffering and death, overcomes death.
            As Benedict XVI concludes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The true shepherd is one who knows even the path that passes through the valley of death; One who walks
              with me even on the path of final solitude, where no one can accompany me, guiding me through: he himself
              has walked this path, he has descended into the kingdom of death, he has conquered death, and he has
              returned to accompany us now and to give us the certainty that, together with him, we can find a way
              through. The realization that there is One who even in death accompanies me, and with his ‘rod and his
              staff comforts me,’ so that ‘I fear no evil,’ this was the new ‘hope’ that arose over the life of
              believers. (Spe Salvi, #6)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Faith alone is not enough, although it is essential.
            Faith gives us an encounter with the living Christ and we begin to understand what our life is meant to be.
            But hope builds on this encounter.
            Not only are we invited to participate in Christ’s vision of the world, we are invited to have confident
            hope in his having overcome the wages of sin, which is death.
            Hope lets us make Christ’s conquering our own: with the help of his grace, we will safely pass through even
            the sufferings and terrors of our own deaths.
            The eternally satisfying goods that belong to Jesus will be shared with us, and so, making his good our own,
            we make his hope our own as well.</p>
          <p>Today, pray in hope.
            In confidence ask Christ to give you the kingdom of God, even now, within your own heart.
            Ask him to let the eternal life that he has promised begin now in this earthly life. </p>
          <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

          <hr>
          <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
          <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
          <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
          <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
          <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
            This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and
            which gives us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end.

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before
              they see the kingdom of God come with power.” And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and
              John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them, and his
              garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on earth could bleach them. And there appeared
              to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus. And Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is well
              that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” For he did
              not know what to say, for they were exceedingly afraid. And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came
              out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son; listen to him.” And suddenly looking around they no longer saw
              any one with them but Jesus only.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Benedict XVI writes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“[Our] great hope can only be God, who encompasses the whole of reality and who can bestow upon us what
              we, by ourselves, cannot attain.
              The fact that it comes to us as a gift is actually part of hope. God is the foundation of hope... the God
              who has a human face and who has loved us to the end.... His Kingdom is present wherever he is loved and
              wherever his love reaches us. His love alone gives us the possibility of soberly persevering day by day,
              without ceasing to be spurred on by hope, in a world which by its very nature is imperfect. His love is at
              the same time our guarantee of the existence of what we only vaguely sense and which nevertheless, in our
              deepest self, we await: a life that is ‘truly’ life. (Spe Salvi, #31)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>We can make Christ’s confidence our own, precisely because we can rely on God’s love and power to give us
            divine goods.
            Hope, therefore, is two-fold: it lets us see the rewards and graces given to Christ as things that are also
            meant for us.
            Those divine gifts—the gift of knowing God, of being made his son, of acting with the strength of his mighty
            power—those gifts belong to us, even here on earth, inasmuch as we partake in Christ.
            And that is the second part of hope: we have confidence in claiming these divine gifts because we have them
            as gifts.
            If we did not realize this glory is ours in virtue of divine graciousness, then we would either not really
            understand how awesome these gifts are, or how lowly we are.
            But in either case, we would not be sharing in Christ’s confidence, because Christ both comprehends the
            abyss between God and man and utter confidence in his Father’s infinite love to overcome that abyss. </p>
          <p>When we share in Christ’s own confidence, the divine goods of the Kingdom of God will be accessible in our
            present lives.
            Christ did not walk the earth in transfigured glory, but hid that reality within him, a reality present by
            his confident union with his Father in his human will, even as he prepared to be crucified.
            Christ’s transfiguration is a physical manifestation of the reality of our hope.
            Such hope is awe-inspiring because it opens up expectations that we had never before considered. </p>
          <p>If we share in Christ’s confidence and grace, we will also share in the labors asked of him as he pursued
            eternal life.
            We may, like Peter, desire to bask in the confidence of hope, without enduring the struggles.
            But God is gentle, and he reminds us that he will be with us, like a pillar of cloud, to shade us in the
            burning heat of our struggles.
            Pray in hope today, asking God in his infinite mercy to sustain you through the remaining labors of Lent,
            and to fill you with grace of the forgiveness of sins and the hope of resurrected life.</p>

          <p><em>And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd about them, and scribes arguing with them.
              And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and ran up to him and greeted him.
              And he asked them, “What are you discussing with them?” And one of the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I
              brought my son to you, for he has a dumb spirit; and wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he
              foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not
              able.” And he answered them, “O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear
              with you? Bring him to me.” And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it
              convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked his
              father, “How long has he had this?” And he said, “From childhood. And it has often cast him into the fire
              and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.” And Jesus
              said to him, “If you can! All things are possible to him who believes.” Immediately the father of the
              child cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!” And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running
              together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out
              of him, and never enter him again.” And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the
              boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, “He is dead.” But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted
              him up, and he arose. And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we
              not cast it out?” And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and
              fasting.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Prayer and fasting; communion and suffering: this is the battleground of hope.
            We pray in hope, and we suffer, voluntarily and involuntarily, in hope.
            And it is only through prayer and suffering that we can help to heal the sufferings of others.
            Certain afflictions can only be driven out by prayer and fasting because these are what purify and make us
            better able to be channels of Christ’s saving grace. </p>
          <p>Benedict XVI writes: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>When we pray properly, we undergo a process of inner purification which opens us up to God and thus to
              our fellow human beings as well. In prayer we must learn what we can truly ask of God—what is worthy of
              God. We must learn that we cannot pray against others. We must learn that we cannot ask for the
              superficial and comfortable things that we desire at this moment—that meagre, misplaced hope that leads us
              away from God. We must learn to purify our desires and our hopes. We must free ourselves from the hidden
              lies with which we deceive ourselves.... My encounter with God awakens my conscience in such a way that it
              no longer aims at self-justification, and is no longer a mere reflection of me and those of my
              contemporaries who shape my thinking, but it becomes a capacity for listening to the Good itself.... In
              this way we undergo those purifications by which we become open to God and are prepared for the service of
              our fellow human beings. We become capable of the great hope, and thus we become ministers of hope for
              others. (Spe Salvi, #33,34)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This prayer as an act of hope demands that our prayer be deeply personal, raw, vulnerable and honest.
            But as with faith, our interior life is always measured by God who transcends us, and therefore we need our
            prayer also to be measured by and offered in union with the prayers of the Church: the psalms, the Our
            Father, the Hail Mary, the prayers of the liturgy.
            Just as there is a dialogue between the teachings of faith and our inner life of faith, so too is there a
            dialogue between public and private prayer.</p>
          <p>This purifying prayer and fasting enlarges our hearts, increases our confidence in God, and makes us more
            aware of our dependence on his help.
            It also increases our hope.
            If we are too confident in our own power, or if we doubt that God wishes to liberate the captive, or doubt
            that he wishes to work through us, our hope is imperfect. </p>
          <p>Pray today with hope.
            Confess your weaknesses to God and ask him to come and heal them and use you as a vessel of mercy to the
            world.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
            This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and
            which gives us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it; for he was
              teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they
              will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.” But they did not understand the
              saying, and they were afraid to ask him. And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt
              before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said to him,
              “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not kill, Do not
              commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’”
              And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.” And Jesus looking upon him loved
              him, and said to him, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have
              treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” At that saying his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowful;
              for he had great possessions.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>The daily grind of Christian living can be exhausting.
            Keeping the commandments, falling, repenting, returning to live out God’s law—that alone is challenging.
            To add to that our work to help others, to practice almsgiving and works of mercy, to pour ourselves out for
            the good of those we love, and to see no results for such effort, this too is exhausting.
            As Benedict XVI notes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Only the great certitude of hope that my own life and history in general, despite all failures, are held
              firm by the indestructible power of Love, and that this gives them their meaning and importance, only this
              kind of hope can then give the courage to act and to persevere. (Spe Salvi, #35) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Our efforts to love others and serve as a vessel of mercy will not transform this world into the Kingdom of
            God; the Kingdom remains a gratuitous gift wherever it arises in the hearts of men.<br>And our efforts alone
            will not earn eternal life.
            Heaven is always a gift.
            Benedict XVI continues:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Even when we are fully aware that Heaven far exceeds what we can merit, it will always be true that our
              behavior is not indifferent before God and therefore is not indifferent for the unfolding of history. We
              can open ourselves and the world and allow God to enter: we can open ourselves to truth, to love, to what
              is good. This is what the saints did, those who, as ‘God's fellow workers,’ contributed to the world's
              salvation. (Spe Salvi, #35) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Our actions, therefore, can communicate hope to those in need; our almsgiving can be the occasion of
            rejuvenating someone who is suffering.
            Ultimately, our actions are rooted in the fruits of the great hope we have in Christ Jesus.
            If we believed that by our own power we could please God as Jesus did, we would soon fail, and, like the
            rich man, go away sad.
            But if we confidently rely on the power of Christ, then we will be sustained even as we sacrificially give
            of ourselves to those in need.</p>
          <p>Resolve to make a concrete act of mercy today, both to communicate hope to someone, and to express the
            confidence of hope in the power of his love that is growing within your heart.</p>

          <p><em>And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; and they were
              amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to
              happen to him, saying, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the
              chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles; and
              they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and kill him; and after three days he will rise.”
              …And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are supposed to rule over the
              Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among
              you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must
              be slave of all. For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a
              ransom for many.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Like action, suffering is both a battleground to learn hope and a opportunity to express it.
            Benedict XVI writes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>It is not by sidestepping or fleeing from suffering that we are healed, but rather by our capacity for
              accepting it, maturing through it and finding meaning through union with Christ, who suffered with
              infinite love.... Hence in all human suffering we are joined by one who experiences and carries that
              suffering with us. (Spe Salvi, #37,39) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Christ has come to suffer not to spare us from suffering, but to teach us how to suffer united with him so
            that we can continue his redemptive work.
            The level of suffering and the intensity of hope it requires.
            But whether in the smallest inconveniences, or the greatest challenges, we are invited to use sufferings to
            exercise our confident hope that through our suffering, God is able to purify and sanctify us as well as to
            purify others. </p>
          <p>Benedict XVI continues:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Our capacity to suffer depends on the type and extent of the hope that we bear within us and build upon.
              The saints were able to make the great journey of human existence in the way that Christ had done before
              them, because they were brimming with great hope. (Spe Salvi, #39)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>We can start by making acts of hope in our small sufferings so that we may grow to be capable of hope in
            our great sufferings.
            We should also be inspired by the witness of those who have gone before us.
            The transformative power of Christ’s grace is made manifest in the saints.
            Heroic faith and hope shine in the faces of the saints and martyrs who have given their lives for the love
            of Christ and his brothers.</p>
          <p>Today, resolve to make every inconvenience and suffering, small or big, an occasion to exercise hope in
            Christ.
            Offer that suffering to him, united to his suffering, with confident hope that your suffering will extend
            his redemption into the world around you.</p>

          <p><em>And they came to Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude,
              Bartimae′us, a blind beggar, the son of Timae′us, was sitting by the roadside. And when he heard that it
              was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” And many
              rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
              And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; rise,
              he is calling you.” And throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus. And Jesus said to him,
              “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Master, let me receive my sight.” And
              Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he received his sight and
              followed him on the way.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>The last sign that Jesus works in St. John’s Gospel is the raising of Lazarus.
            In St. Mark’s Gospel, the last miracle that Jesus works before his triumphant entrance into Jerusalem is the
            curing of the blind man—a man who is the son of a Gentile (Timaeus) but who is named as a Hebrew,
            Bartimaeus.
            This last miracle unites the entire message of the Gospel up to this point: Christ has come to extend his
            redemption beyond Israel to all men.
            He comes to undo the curse of Adam and to transform us into the sons of God.
            He wants us to call out in prayer to him in the midst of our suffering and ask for his mercy.
            We call out when we pray, when we fast, and when we extend mercy to others.
            And in these activities, Christ comes to us, enters our experience, and transforms it, giving us a share in
            his divine life and redemptive work. </p>
          <p>He gives us faith so that we can know God as he does.
            And having faith, we can follow him in hope, confident that he will supply for all we lack, enabling us to
            go where he is going and do what he is doing.
            Often We often hear Christians say that such and such a charitable act is the work of a Mother Teresa, or
            that intense prayer is what monks do.
            The implication is that what Christ did and the way he did it is only obtainable by a select few.
            Instead, St. Mark’s Gospel tells us: ask God to transform you into Christ.
            Deepen your experience of faith: hear God’s word!
            Strive to see his face!
            Do everything you can to make this gift a reality, even though nothing you can do will ever earn such a
            gift.
            Pray!
            Fast!
            Give alms!
            And have confidence that he will transform you.
            Get up and follow him, even to his Cross.</p>
          <p>But as you follow him in faith and hope, it will become clear that there is yet a further and more perfect
            way that Christ wishes to transform you.
            We will consider the virtue of charity next week.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the

          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in Jerusalem.</strong>
            At last, we have arrived in Jerusalem.
            This is the final week of preparation for our encounter with the Risen Christ.
            We have focused on preparing though prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. We have spent the last two weeks
            meditating on how we are interiorly transformed to be Christ in faith and in hope.
            Now this week, we will focus on the greatest transformation: our transformation to love with Christ’s love.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>

          <p><em>And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Beth′phage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of
              his disciples, and said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you
              will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it. If any one says to you, ‘Why
              are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’” And they went
              away, and found a colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it. And those who stood
              there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” And they told them what Jesus had said; and
              they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it.
              And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the
              fields. And those who went before and those who followed cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in
              the name of the Lord! Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna in the highest!”
              And he entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had looked round at everything, as it was
              already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Palm Sunday is an intermediate day, partly anticipating the joy of Easter, partly anticipating the deep
            sorrows of the Cross.
            If the Transfiguration of Christ manifests to us the virtue of hope, Palm Sunday is a manifestation to us of
            divine charity, partially hidden, and partially revealed. </p>
          <p>St. Paul writes that there are three virtues that endure into heaven because they pertain to God.
            These virtues are more divine than human, transforming us even now to enable us to participate in the
            divine-human life of Jesus Christ.
            Those three virtues are faith, hope, and love.
            St. Paul adds that the greatest of these is love.
            Love is the crown of the virtues, the most God-like activity that we can do.
            God alone perfectly loves himself, with the Father infinitely breathing forth the Spirit of Love upon his
            Son.
            All creatures are made God-like to the extent that they love as God loves.
            No creature can love the infinitely lovable God as much as he can and should be loved; they can only love
            God as much they are able, striving always to contemplate God with love.
            Perpetual, conscious contemplation of God belongs to eternal life.
            Only those purified beings in heaven are capable of that perfection of love.</p>
          <p>But in this life, we must love consciously and unconsciously.
            A husband cannot think of his wife every second, but he must still be faithful to his vows at every moment
            of the day, even when he is not consciously thinking of his wife.
            So too for Christians in this life, we will need to sleep, focus on difficult tasks, and the rest, but at
            all times we must live such that nothing we do or think is more important to us than God.
            Further, everything we do needs to be ultimately—if not always consciously—ordered to God.
            Just as a married man must order all of his work toward loving and caring for his wife, so too must we order
            all we do to our loving relationship with God. </p>
          <p>We are in an intermediate stage: at times our love for God is manifest and conscious, and at times it is
            hidden and unconscious.
            The grace God has poured into our hearts is hidden, but the more conscious acts of love we make, the more we
            strive to live in God’s presence, the more we will experience his grace flowing into our hearts.
            Although the perfection of the saints in heaven is not yet possible to us, we must nevertheless endeavor to
            emulate it.
            During this last week of Lent, it is especially good to be as consciously attentive to God and to make as
            many acts of love of him as possible.
            Every act of love will make our love for God increase.</p>
          <p>On this Palm Sunday, make conscious acts of love toward God, rejoicing in his love and goodness, and
            praying to be transformed by his Paschal love.</p>

          <p><em>On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing in the distance a fig tree
              in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves,
              for it was not the season for figs. And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his
              disciples heard it. And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who
              sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats
              of those who sold pigeons; and he would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple. And he
              taught, and said to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the
              nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and
              sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his
              teaching. And when evening came they went out of the city.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>After triumphantly entering into Jerusalem, Jesus returns to Bethany to stay with Mary, Martha, and
            Lazarus.
            On the next morning he returns to Jerusalem, and on the way he curses the barren fig tree.
            Adam and Eve had clothed themselves in the leaves of the fig tree, but Jesus declares it is no longer the
            time for the fallen dispensation.
            He has come to replace the fig tree with the tree of life, the tree of the Cross which he will plant in the
            heart of every man.</p>
          <p>The fig-tree was a sign of hiding from God, a sign of a mode of seeing the world that no longer was in
            loving communion with the Creator.
            Now, Christ comes to reveal the fullness of divine love, to restore a loving marital union to his people.
            Whereas the fig tree hides, Christ reveals.
            The fig tree represents a rebellion against God’s commandments, but Christ inscribes them in our hearts.
          </p>
          <p>Benedict XVI sums up this vision of Christ’s love in Deus Caritas Est (#17): </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In the gradual unfolding of this encounter, it is clearly revealed that love is not merely a sentiment.
              Sentiments come and go.… It is characteristic of mature love that it calls into play all man's
              potentialities; it engages the whole man. Contact with the visible manifestations of God's love can awaken
              within us a feeling of joy born of the experience of being loved. But this encounter also engages our will
              and our intellect. Acknowledgment of the living God is the one path towards love, and the “yes” of our
              will to his will unites our intellect, will and sentiments in the all- embracing act of love. But this
              process is always open-ended; love is never ‘finished’ and complete; throughout life, it changes and
              matures, and thus remains faithful to itself.… The love-story between God and man consists in the very
              fact that this communion of will increases in a communion of thought and sentiment, and thus our will and
              God's will increasingly coincide: God's will is no longer for me an alien will, something imposed on me
              from without by the commandments, but it is now my own will, based on the realization that God is in fact
              more deeply present to me than I am to myself. Then self- abandonment to God increases and God becomes our
              joy. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>During Holy Week, rejoice in the love that Christ has for you.
            Invite him into your heart to purify it from all other attachments, that you may abandon yourself completely
            to a loving worship of the Bridegroom.
            May we be transformed.</p>

          <h2 id="week-6-action-items">Week 6 Action Items</h2>
          <p><strong>1. Enter into Holy Week fully.</strong>
            Don’t let this be just another week.
            Our prayer discipline calls for a daily holy hour.
            In these final days, set your alarm, get up early, go to the chapel or light a candle beside a crucifix at
            home, and let the Lord change your life as you sit before him in your holy hour. </p>
          <p><strong>2. Consider increasing your fasting.</strong>
            Sprint to the finish line!
            Push yourself in fasting.
            Decrease your food intake or your sleep.
            Now is the time to put it all on the line.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Don't give in to distractions this week.</strong>
            Silence your phone, turn off notifications, deactivate badge icons.
            Do whatever it takes to stay close to Christ, to finish this exercise strongly, to be present to your
            family, and to live as a free man.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Keep moving forward this Easter.</strong>
            If you go back to the way you lived before Lent, you’re likely to slide back and return to the vices you
            struggled with then.
            We need to learn to celebrate well, in a way that expresses our joy in God without losing the discipline
            that we have achieved.
            If you make a plan to celebrate Easter in a disciplined way, you’re more likely to avoid falling back and
            instead will keep moving forward.
            Exodus’s Easter exercise will focus on building a sustainable rule of life, balancing celebration and
            discipline. </p>
          <p><strong>5. Stick with your brothers.</strong>
            You may not know how important your brothers have been to you along this journey.
            Keep investing in one another and building your friendship.
            Talk with your fraternity about keeping things going during Easter.
            Talk about how you plan to feast, reflect, and keep moving forward.</p>

          <p><em>And they came again to Jerusalem. … And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one
              another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the first of all?” Jesus
              answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord
              your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’
              The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than
              these.” And the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that he is one, and there
              is no other but he; and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the
              strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and
              sacrifices.” And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom
              of God.” And after that no one dared to ask him any question. And he sat down opposite the treasury, and
              watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. And a poor
              widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny. And he called his disciples to him, and said
              to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the
              treasury. For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in
              everything she had, her whole living.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>On Tuesday of Holy week, Jesus visits the temple for the last time, and from within the temple he declares:
            greater than all burnt offerings and sacrifices is loving God with all your heart, mind, and strength.
            What makes Jesus’ coming sacrifice of infinite value is not merely the suffering and the blood, but rather,
            the intensity and perfection of his love for the Father and his love for all mankind.
            And this act of love is total: he gives himself entirely: body, blood, soul, and divinity.
            There is no more that he can give. </p>
          <p>Christ invites us to reciprocate in love.
            He invites us to hasten to him with the entirety of our being: our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
            As St. Nicholas Cabasilas writes, </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>[Christ] is the resting place of human desires; he is the good of our thoughts. We are to love him alone.
              But that we may turn our love toward him at all times… there is no need of any special formulas for
              prayers, nor need to call upon him from any special place. There is no place in which he is not present;
              it is impossible for him not to be near us. For those who seek him He is actually closer than their very
              hearts.” (Life in Christ, Bk. VI.13)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Our love is not limited to the temple; nor do we have to express it through particular animal sacrifices.
            Rather, at all times, and in all places we are to live in such a way that all of our life is a loving gift
            of self to Christ.
            At times we may not be able to be actively attentive to his love, but we must always make this love the
            fundamental driving force of our lives.</p>
          <p>If we do this, our very life is an expression of heavenly life.
            St. Nicholas continues: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>All that is ours follows the will and moves where it is born by it.… If then, to imitate Christ and to
              live according to him is to live in Christ, this life is the effect of the will when it obeys God’s
              purposes.… What then may life be more fittingly called than love? For that which alone survives and does
              not allow the living to die when all things have been taken away is life—and such is love. When all things
              have passed away in the age to come love remains, and it alone suffices for life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
              (Life in Christ, Bk. VII.15)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Today, pray acts of love to God.
            In your prayer, will to love him with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength
            precisely because he alone is God.
            Give your whole self to God with love, for Christ has given his whole self to you with love.<br>Let us be
            transformed.</p>

          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and
              the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him; for they said, “Not during the feast,
              lest there be a tumult of the people.” And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
              sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the
              jar and poured it over his head. But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, “Why was the
              ointment thus wasted? For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and
              given to the poor.” And they reproached her. But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She
              has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do
              good to them; but you will not always have me. She has done what she could; she has anointed my body
              beforehand for burying. And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what
              she has done will be told in memory of her.”</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>On this Wednesday of Holy Week, what we also call Spy Wednesday, we are reminded of the order of love: God,
            and God alone, is our first love.
            He has loved us completely and extravagantly, and we are to respond to him in like manner.
            The ointment of the woman was worth 300 denarii, almost a year’s worth of day wages.
            St. John’s Gospel tells us that it was Judas Iscariot who objected to this “waste” of the ointment when the
            money could have been given to the poor, “not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as
            he had the money box he used to take what was put into it” (John 12:6).
            Although comparing ancient currencies is difficult, when Judas agrees to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of
            silver, he is probably accepting no more than half the value of the perfume. </p>
          <p>We cannot allow our love for God to be moderated under the pretext of love for our neighbor; when we do
            this, it will also undermine the love of our neighbor which we profess to be concerned with.
            As Benedict XVI writes: "Practical activity will always be insufficient, unless it visibly expresses a love
            for man, a love nourished by an encounter with Christ” (Deus Caritas Est, #34). </p>
          <p>Our love for Christ is what enlivens our love for our neighbor.
            As Benedict XVI continues:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Faith, hope, and charity go together. Hope is practiced through the virtue of patience, which continues
              to do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's
              mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes
              and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our
              impatience and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that in spite of
              all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced
              heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light—and in the end, the only light—that can
              always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is
              possible, and we are able to practice it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love
              and in this way to cause the light of God to enter into the world." (Deus Caritas Est, #39)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Today, renew the right ordering of love within yourself.
            We must love others because Christ loves us, and we love him.
            Do not be like the Pharisee who remains impassive even when Christ is present in his home; be transformed by
            charity!
            Do not be like Judas and let selfish greed masquerade as concern for others.
            Be overwhelmed by love for Jesus!
            Anoint him with your love, and allow him to anoint you with his love.
            Unite all of your work, all of your successes and failures to his loving sacrifice of his life.
            Let your love be joined to his, and let that love illuminate even the darkness of the tomb.
            Be transformed.</p>

          <p><em>And when it was evening he came with the Twelve. And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, “Truly,
              I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.” They began to be sorrowful, and to
              say to him one after another, “Is it I?” He said to them, “It is one of the Twelve, one who is dipping
              bread into the dish with me. For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom
              the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.” And as they
              were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my
              body.” And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And
              he said to them, “This is my blood of the {new} covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly, I say to
              you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of
              God.” And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>We must seek the food that truly satisfies us.
            Benedict XVI tells us, in Deus Caritas Est (#13): </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Jesus anticipated his death and resurrection by giving his disciples, in the bread and wine, his very
              self, his body and blood as the new manna. The ancient world had dimly perceived that man's real food—what
              truly nourishes him as man—is ultimately the Logos, eternal wisdom: this same Logos now truly becomes food
              for us—as love. The Eucharist draws us into Jesus' act of self-oblation. More than just statically
              receiving the incarnate Logos, we enter into the very dynamic of his self-giving. The imagery of marriage
              between God and Israel is now realized in a way previously inconceivable: it had meant standing in God's
              presence, but now it becomes union with God through sharing in Jesus' self-gift, sharing in his body and
              blood. The sacramental “mysticism”, grounded in God's condescension towards us, operates at a radically
              different level and lifts us to far greater heights than anything that any human mystical elevation could
              ever accomplish.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Eucharist is the bread of charity: it feeds and sustains our love for Christ.
            Each time we receive the Eucharist we should strive to receive Christ with more zeal, more longing, more
            attention than we have done previously, and in this way, our charity will increase.
            Christ gives himself to us in the Eucharist in the measure that we give ourselves to him.
            It is the moment when we surrender to God’s love in response to his incredible self-gift of love and life
            that he offers to us. </p>
          <p>At this moment, we participate in the heavenly banquet; our life here and the life of the world to come
            meet.
            Jesus Christ is the substance of our eternal life; and our love, which we have received from him, is what
            lets us participate in that substance.
            All else fades in the presence of this reality.</p>
          <p>Christians have been celebrating the Eucharistic feast for two thousand years.
            Allow the Lord to open the eyes of your heart to understand this life-changing mystery.
            Receive the love of God and let it transform you. </p>

          <p>Today, love has revealed itself.
            Benedict XVI writes, once again in Deus Caritas Est (#12): </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Jesus’ death on the Cross is the culmination by which God gives himself in order to raise man up and save
              him. This is love in its most radical form. By contemplating the pierced side of Christ we can understand
              that “God is love” (1 John 4:8). It is there that this truth can be contemplated. It is from there that
              our definition of love must begin. In this contemplation the Christian discovers the path along which his
              life and love must move.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In Mark’s Gospel, the only person who confesses Jesus to be the Son of God is the centurion who sees Jesus
            breathing his last.
            It is this moment that completes Peter’s first confession that Jesus is the Christ.
            It is the second step in the gift of faith.
            Men knew there was something special about Jesus, but only on the Cross is the fullness of his divinity
            revealed.
            What is St. Mark saying?</p>
          <p>Faith for its fullest expression requires love.
            While we might laugh at the lover who sees wondrous beauty in his beloved, it is perhaps most true that only
            the lover really sees his beloved as she really is.
            All the rest of us are not looking intently enough to see her dignity and worth.
            Jesus reveals himself in love; his last act is to breathe his last, that is, to give forth his Spirit, his
            love. </p>
          <p>The Spirit revealed in faith at his baptism, the Spirit that accompanied him in hope at his transfiguration
            is now may manifest in love.
            In his most extreme agony, Jesus cries out to the Father who had proclaimed him at the beginning of his
            ministry.
            The Trinity revealed at his baptism in prophetic signs is now made manifest for all mankind upon the Cross.
          </p>
          <p>Today, let us contemplate Christ crucified and see in him the fullest presence of divinizing love.
            Be transformed.</p>

          <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
          <p><strong>You are in Jerusalem.</strong>
            This week, we will focus on the greatest transformation: to love with Christ’s love.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
          <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
          <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
          <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
          <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
              Thy kingdom come.
              Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
              Give us this day our daily bread.
              And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
              And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
              Amen.</em></p>
          <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
          <p><em>And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
              Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of
              God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate wondered if he were
              already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. And when he learned
              from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph. And he bought a linen shroud, and
              taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the
              rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw
              where he was laid. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and
              Salome, bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week
              they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the
              stone for us from the door of the tomb?” And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; for it
              was very large. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white
              robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them, “Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was
              crucified. He has risen, he is not here; see the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and
              Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.” And they went out
              and fled from the tomb; for trembling and ecstasy had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one,
              for they were afraid.</em></p>
          <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
          <p>Love calls us out of ourselves.</p>
          <p>Benedict XVI writes: </p>
          <p>Love is indeed ‘ecstasy’, not in the sense of a moment of intoxication, but rather as a journey, an ongoing
            exodus out of the closed inward-looking self towards its liberation through self-giving, and thus towards
            authentic self-discovery and indeed the discovery of God. (Deus Caritas Est, #6) </p>
          <p>Love calls us out of ourselves.
            The love that brought the myrrh-bearing women to the tomb of Christ was transformed into ecstasy when they
            beheld the angel and the empty tomb.
            They may well have experienced what St. John of Dalyatha describes as a step in the prayer life of
            Christians: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The mind may be transported by the Spirit to an eternal ocean of light, falling into ecstasy,
              transfigured with great joy. Immersed in this light, the mind surges with the action of love and joy … it
              gazes upon the shining angels and there is entrapped and overwhelmed by the vision of glory. (Homily on
              Theoria) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>We come to the tomb today, and wait in loving silence, offering whatever gifts we are able to bring.
            And Christ will transform those meager gifts into an astonishing, ecstatic experience of divine love drawing
            us ever upward. </p>
          <p>The earliest manuscripts of Mark’s Gospel end with this verse anticipating the vision of the risen Lord.
            St. Mark has led us through the transforming, divinizing journey of following Christ, and he leaves us
            waiting to encounter the risen Lord in the light of Easter morning.</p>
          <p>Let us wait.
            Let us love.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
