                <h2>Open with Prayer</h2>
                <p>This prayer is said together at the beginning of each meeting. It unites all Exodus Men in one common
                    and continuous prayer to our Lord: </p>
                <h3>Opening Prayer</h3>
                <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit…</i></p>
                <p><b>All:</b></p>
                <p>And he said to all, “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily
                    and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake,
                    he will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits
                    himself? (Luke 9:23-25)</p>
                <p class="red"><b>Reader:</b></p>
                <p class="red"><i>Lord Jesus, you are commanding us to be men for others. You are commanding us to leave
                        behind old ways, to deny selfish desires, to embrace daily hardships with joy, and to orient our
                        lives completely to you. Help us each day to learn what it means to lay down our life for our
                        friends through a disciplined life of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity. Give us a desire to
                        follow you in all things; give us joy in suffering; and the courage to lead others to you.</i>
                </p>

                <p><b>All:</b></p>
                <p><i>Thank you, Lord Jesus, for the gift of this fraternity. May you continue to work
                        through my brothers to challenge me and encourage me to be the man you are calling me to be: a
                        man for others. <br>Amen. <br><br>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
                        Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2> Field Reports</h2>
                <p>Each man comes prepared to give a ninety-second report of his experience in the field over the past
                    week. His report should briefly cover all three pillars of the spiritual exercise: prayer,
                    asceticism, and fraternity. Major shortcomings should be discussed, while minor shortcomings may be
                    acknowledged. Lastly, gratitude should be given to God for the blessings of the past week.
                    <br><br>The fraternity leader is responsible for:
                </p>

                <ul class="short-list">
                    <li>Seeing that each man in the fraternity shares adequately, but not excessively.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that each man recounts the blessings of the past week.</li>
                    <li>Holding the meeting to its task and keeping it from devolving into a group therapy session.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining the fraternity’s focus on the mercy of God in the midst of their exodus.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Daily Bearings</h2>
                <p>The fraternity leader should choose one Guidepost from the week’s daily bearings and lead a
                    discussion on it. The discussion should address how the men are living out the guidepost or possibly
                    struggling with it. It may also cover the kind of changes in life that should be made for each man
                    to better adhere to the guidepost. The fraternity leader can delegate a man each week to choose a
                    guidepost to discuss at the next week’s meeting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Other Business</h2>
                <p>At the end of the meeting, the fraternity leader should:</p>
                <ul class="short-list">
                    <li>See that everyone knows the time and place of the next fraternity meeting.</li>
                    <li>Make plans regarding fraternity outings or appropriately delegate them to others in the
                        fraternity.</li>
                    <li>Bring up other fraternity business such as arrangements for fraternity Masses or holy hours,
                        times with a spiritual director, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
                <p>The meeting ends with the St. Michael the Archangel prayer for the spiritual protection of the
                    fraternity, all Exodus Men, priests, families, and the sanctification of the Church.</p>
                <p><b>Saint Michael the Archangel Prayer</b></p>
                <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit…</i></p>
                <p><i>St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and
                        snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly
                        hosts, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the
                        world seeking the ruin of souls.</i></p>
                <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
            </li>
