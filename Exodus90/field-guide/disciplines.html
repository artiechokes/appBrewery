                    a loophole for watching whatever you want by having another person sit beside you. Just keep your

        DAILY
        Abstain from video games
        Do not play video games on a game system, computer, mobile device, or by any other means. Instead, offer up this
        sacrifice and consider what God may be calling you to do with that time.


        DAILY
        Abstain from eating between meals
        Do not eat anything between meals. Practice disciplining your appetite to strengthen your will.


        DAILY
        Abstain from desserts and sweets
        Do not eat desserts or sweets- not as part of a meal nor as a snack. Each time you turn down sweets, offer it up
        in a
        spirit of sacrifice and penance.


        DAILY
        Abstain from soda and sweet drinks
        Do not drink anything sweet. This includes soda, fruit juices, sweet sports drinks, and not adding milk or
        sweeteners to
        coffee or tea.

        DAILY
        Listen only to music that lifts the soul to God
        Listen only to music that lifts the soul to God. While this does not have to be explicitly Christian music, it
        should
        not contain messages that encourage sin or negativity.


        DAILY
        Abstain from non-essential purchases
        Do not make any purchases that are not necessary. (This includes not eating out unless there is a special
        occasion that
        cannot be celebrated otherwise.)

        DAILY
        Anchor Check-In
        Check in with your anchor daily. It’s critical for both of you as you climb each peak. This should usually be a
        brief
        meeting or phone call, but on a busy day a text conversation is acceptable.

        DAILY
        Get a full night's sleep (at least seven hours is recommended)
        Plan your day and responsibilities to try to get at least 7 hours of sleep. (If you have an infant, just do your
        best
        while still helping your wife.)

        DAILY
        Make a Nightly Examen
        At the end of the day, prayerfully examine your actions (and inactions) throughout the day. Where did you see
        God
        working in your life? Acknowledge where you responded to God’s grace and where you chose to do otherwise.


        Fast on Wednesday and Friday
        On all Wednesdays and Fridays, abstain from meat and only eat one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that
        together
        are not equal to the full meal.


        Abstain from meat on Wednesday and Friday
        Do not consume meat on these days. Look for other sources of protein such as beans, peanut butter, etc. Please
        be sure
        to stay hydrated.

        Practice regular, intense exercise
        You should exercise at least 3 times per week doing something rigorous enough to get your heart rate up. (If you
        have
        guidance from your doctor, please follow that.)

        Weekly Fraternity Meeting
        Once a week, everyone in your fraternity should meet to check in about their fidelity to the disciplines and
        pray
        together. Stay faithful to this commitment you made to your brothers. Don’t just "go along for the ride.” Do
        your part
        to make your fraternity a committed band of brothers.
