        <p><b>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</b> Remember the glory that God has called you to, how you have
            fallen from that glory, and how much you depend on his saving help.</p>

        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>
        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>
