                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television,
                    movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from
                    doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.
                </p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an
                    explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/fidelity-to-prayer.html">Fidelity to
                        Prayer</a> from the Field Guide. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you, check out
                    the

                        Guide.</a>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity
                    to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential
                    communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your
                    freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer
                    him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept
                    the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/the-gift-of-asceticism.html">The Gift of
                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>

                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It
                    acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to
                    go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also
                    give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live
                    different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our
                    relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person
                    for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
