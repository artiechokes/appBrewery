        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee.</strong>
            Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things that are not of Christ. He has great things in store
            for us. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h2 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p><em>Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, “Why do John’s
                disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
                And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?
                As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
                The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
                No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the
                new from the old, and a worse tear is made.
                And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is
                lost, and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins.”</em></p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>Why don’t your disciples fast? This seems like an odd question to us in the midst of our Lenten fast.
            Very clearly, the disciples of Jesus do fast, and at times exhaustingly so! It is all the more surprising to
            hear Jesus say that not only are his disciples not fasting, they cannot do so.
            But he promises that the time will come when they will fast.</p>
        <p>What are we to make of this?
            First, Jesus is using fasting as a further way to reveal himself.
            He is not only God become Son of man who has entered into our humanity, he is also our Bridegroom.
            He does not leave us broken and sad, but has come to fill us with joy as at a wedding celebration.
            The fast of John the Baptist and the Pharisees stressed their sinfulness, their waiting for the coming of
            the Savior who would reunite God and man. Christians need not participate in this fast.
            That would be putting new wine into old wine skins.
            Christians are not longing for the coming of a Redeemer; instead, Christians are proclaiming that their
            Beloved is here with them, and his presence fills them with joy.</p>
        <p>When Christians fast, therefore, we are always joyfully aware of the presence of our Redeemer. For this
            reason, we must “anoint your head and wash your face” (Matthew 6:17) and be content even when fasting.
            Our penance is no longer a sign of God’s absence, but it is a sign that we are journeying with our
            Bridegroom.
            What joy!</p>
        <p>And yet, the Bridegroom is not fully present to us.
            This is not because he is far away, but rather, because our love is weak.
            Our Bridegroom is present in our souls through our love, and when our love is weak, it is as if he were far
            away, even though he is in reality more present to us than we are to ourselves.
            Therefore, we fast so we may grow in love, so that the God-Man may ever more be present in our souls and we
            may experience more fully the happiness of his presence. </p>
        <p>We are wedded to Christ. He cannot be taken from us, although we ourselves can abandon him. So let us turn
            today with all of our powers of attention and cleave to him.
            Let us invite him into our fasting so that he might break down whatever attachments keep us away from him.
            And let us affirm with joy that God becoming man has joined us to him forever.</p>

        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Face temptations in prayer.</li>
            <li>Detach through asceticism.</li>
            <li>Seek Reconciliation with God and others.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television, movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.</p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/fidelity-to-prayer.html">Fidelity to
                        Prayer</a> from the Field Guide. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you, check out the

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/the-gift-of-asceticism.html">The Gift of
                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
