        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings
            for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee.</strong>
            Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things that are not of Christ. He has great things in
            store for us. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this
            season of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h2 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p>*Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat. And when his
            friends heard it, they went out to seize him, for they said, “He is beside himself.”
            And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beel′zebul, and by the prince of
            demons he casts out the demons.”
            And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?
            If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<br>And if a house is divided against
            itself, that house will not be able to stand.
            And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.
            But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man;
            then indeed he may plunder his house. *</p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>When Jesus’ friends see him casting out demons, what do they see?
            They see a man surrounded by a throbbing, yelling, perhaps partially deranged crowd. He cannot eat. He
            cannot sleep.
            He is surrounded, and apparently in such a state of pain and exhaustion that his friends say, “He is
            beside himself, out of his mind.”
            And his enemies look at him and they assume that he is possessed by a demon; in some ways he looks like
            the very ones he is saving.</p>
        <p>Jesus turns from the crowd in response to the accusation.
            He immediately comes to himself and shows that he is in his right mind; whatever he looks like, whatever
            he feels, he is always in control of himself. He is breaking into the strong man’s house, to the human
            experience of toil and fear, and he is setting humanity free.
            Satan is the strong man; he holds mankind captive through their fear of death, their anxiety, their
            pointless labor.
            And Jesus comes into that house, but he comes not as a prisoner (as his friends thought), not as a
            captor (as the scribes claimed), but as a liberator. </p>
        <p>He invites us to join him in a new mode of living. He invites us to experience the toil of Adam not as a
            demonic chain, but as a sanctifying work, a work that makes present God’s redeeming power.
            On our own we cannot transform our work, as a convict cannot change his prison sentence.
            But Jesus, who has no sin, can take on the toil of Adam and make it a liberating event.
            And once we are liberated, we can share in his work.</p>
        <p>Today let us contemplate the face of Jesus as he appears to his friends and the scribes.
            But let us see that face with more understanding than they did.
            Let us see his pain, his anxiety, and his toil. And let us keep looking until we see his love for us.
            And let us contemplate that face all through this penitential Friday.</p>

            <li>
                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television,
                    movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from
                    doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.
                </p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an
                    explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity
                    to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential
                    communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your
                    freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer
                    him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept
                    the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/the-gift-of-asceticism.html">The Gift of
                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It
                    acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to
                    go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also
                    give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live
                    different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our
                    relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person
                    for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
