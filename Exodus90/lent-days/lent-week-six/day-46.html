    <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
      scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
      the day.</p>
    <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
      transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
    <p><strong>You are in Jerusalem.</strong>
      This week, we will focus on the greatest transformation: to love with Christ’s love.
      Let us be transformed!</p>
    <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
      of Lent.</p>
    <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
    <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
    <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
        Thy kingdom come.
        Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
        Give us this day our daily bread.
        And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
        And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
        Amen.</em></p>
    <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
    <p><em>And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
        Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God,
        took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate wondered if he were already
        dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. And when he learned from the
        centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph. And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him
        down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he
        rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was
        laid. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought
        spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week they went to the
        tomb when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from
        the door of the tomb?” And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; for it was very large. And
        entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were
        amazed. And he said to them, “Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen,
        he is not here; see the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going
        before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.” And they went out and fled from the tomb;
        for trembling and ecstasy had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</em>
    </p>
    <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
    <p>Love calls us out of ourselves.</p>
    <p>Benedict XVI writes: </p>
    <p>Love is indeed ‘ecstasy’, not in the sense of a moment of intoxication, but rather as a journey, an ongoing
      exodus out of the closed inward-looking self towards its liberation through self-giving, and thus towards
      authentic self-discovery and indeed the discovery of God. (Deus Caritas Est, #6) </p>
    <p>Love calls us out of ourselves.
      The love that brought the myrrh-bearing women to the tomb of Christ was transformed into ecstasy when they
      beheld the angel and the empty tomb.
      They may well have experienced what St. John of Dalyatha describes as a step in the prayer life of Christians:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      <p>The mind may be transported by the Spirit to an eternal ocean of light, falling into ecstasy, transfigured
        with great joy. Immersed in this light, the mind surges with the action of love and joy … it gazes upon the
        shining angels and there is entrapped and overwhelmed by the vision of glory. (Homily on Theoria) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We come to the tomb today, and wait in loving silence, offering whatever gifts we are able to bring.
      And Christ will transform those meager gifts into an astonishing, ecstatic experience of divine love drawing
      us ever upward. </p>
    <p>The earliest manuscripts of Mark’s Gospel end with this verse anticipating the vision of the risen Lord.
      St. Mark has led us through the transforming, divinizing journey of following Christ, and he leaves us waiting
      to encounter the risen Lord in the light of Easter morning.</p>
    <p>Let us wait.
      Let us love.
      Let us be transformed.</p>

    <p><i>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,
        consider using the <a href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/how-to-pray-a-holy-hour.html">Holy
          Hour Guide.</a></i></p>

    <h2 id="week-6-action-items">Week 6 Action Items</h2>

    <ol class="short-list">
      <li>Enter into Holy Week fully.</li>
      <li>Consider increasing your fasting.</li>
      <li>Don't give in to distractions this week.</li>
      <li>Keep moving forward this Easter.</li>
      <li>Stick with your brothers.</li>
    </ol>


    <p><strong>1. Enter into Holy Week fully.</strong>
      Don’t let this be just another week.
      Our prayer discipline calls for a daily holy hour.
      In these final days, set your alarm, get up early, go to the chapel or light a candle beside a crucifix at
      home, and let the Lord change your life as you sit before him in your holy hour. </p>
    <p><strong>2. Consider increasing your fasting.</strong>
      Sprint to the finish line!
      Push yourself in fasting.
      Decrease your food intake or your sleep.
      Now is the time to put it all on the line.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Don't give in to distractions this week.</strong>
      Silence your phone, turn off notifications, deactivate badge icons.
      Do whatever it takes to stay close to Christ, to finish this exercise strongly, to be present to your
      family, and to live as a free man.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Keep moving forward this Easter.</strong>
      If you go back to the way you lived before Lent, you’re likely to slide back and return to the vices you
      struggled with then.
      We need to learn to celebrate well, in a way that expresses our joy in God without losing the discipline
      that we have achieved.
      If you make a plan to celebrate Easter in a disciplined way, you’re more likely to avoid falling back and
      instead will keep moving forward.
      Exodus’s Easter exercise will focus on building a sustainable rule of life, balancing celebration and
      discipline. </p>
    <p><strong>5. Stick with your brothers.</strong>
      You may not know how important your brothers have been to you along this journey.
      Keep investing in one another and building your friendship.
      Talk with your fraternity about keeping things going during Easter.
      Talk about how you plan to feast, reflect, and keep moving forward.</p>
