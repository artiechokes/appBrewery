        <h1 class="section-header">Welcome to Lent for Men</h1>
        <p>If this is your first experience of a spiritual exercise from Exodus, welcome! We're so glad that you've
            joined us for this Lent. If you've done Exodus 90 or another spiritual exercise with us in the past, welcome
            back.</p>
        <p>This Lenten exercise is built on three pillars: prayer, asceticism, and fraternity. Through prayer, we learn
            to listen to the voice of God in our lives. Through asceticism (or acts of self-denial), we say "no" to
            ourselves so we can say "yes" to Christ. And through fraternity, we are surrounded by other men who share
            our desire to live a virtuous life and can keep us accountable to keep moving forward toward the Lord. These
            pillars are a roadmap to transformation in Christ, which is the theme of this Lent. As we dive into a life
            of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity through the next 40 days, we will read daily from Saint Mark's Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>Through this Lenten experience, you are entering the broader community of Exodus Men seeking freedom in
            Christ. Welcome to the fraternity! Each and every day, Exodus Men around the world are united in common
            prayer for each other. This exercise will help you to embrace the very goal of Lent itself: to let go of
            attachments, to seek conversion, to be open to the Lord's work in your life, to make reparation, and to
            prepare for the new life of Easter.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings, spending a few minutes of recollection on where you are
            spiritually. Here on Ash Wednesday, what brought you to this Lenten exercise? Where are you in your daily
            life?</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><b>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</b> Lent is a time of penance. We have been made in the image and
            likeness
            of God, but we have severed our relationship with him and been banished from our true home. As we sit in the
            wilderness, we call to mind the good that we have forfeited by our sins, the relationships we have broken,
            and the fragility and suffering of our lives. As we do penance for our sins, fasting intently, consecrating
            these weeks to the Lord, we hear the voice of John the Baptist proclaiming that this penance is necessary to
            prepare ourselves to encounter the One mightier than he.</p>
        <p>And hearing John's voice, we remember how God made us in his image, how we have fallen from that glory, and
            how much we depend on his saving grace to restore us to our original likeness.</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance with the Lord for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>
        <p>When the disciples asked Jesus how to pray, he taught them the "Our Father." Join your Exodus brothers all
            over the world in praying this powerful prayer every day for the intentions above.</p>
        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>

        <h2>A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p><i>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
                "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way; the voice of one crying in
                the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight—" John the Baptist appeared in the
                wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And there went out to him all
                the country of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river
                Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and had a leather belt around his
                waist, and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than
                I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water;
                but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</i></p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>St. Mark begins his account abruptly, announcing that this story will be a "gospel"—an euangelion. In the
            Roman Empire, an euangelion was a message declaring an imperial victory; the emperor had conquered, and his
            subjects could now rejoice in the peace and liberty that he had brought them.</p>
        <p>But St. Mark's Gospel, unlike an imperial proclamation, begins by telling us that while there has been a
            great victory, we first need to remember what we need to be saved from. And John the Baptist is the man
            chosen for that vocation. John appears like a new mighty warrior of God, like Samson or the soldiers of
            ancient Israel, who were fed by wild honey in the wilderness (cf. Judges 14:8-9; I Samuel 14:24-26). But the
            war John the Baptist fights is one of repentance; he is here to remind all of Judea that they must radically
            repent. John's entire life—his intense fasting, his austere dress, his remote dwelling in the wilderness—all
            of this penance testifies to our radical need to repent. We all have sinned. We all have fallen into sins
            that have damaged our relationship with God, our relationship with each other, our relationship with
            ourselves, and our relationship with the world around us. John fasts to tame his own bodily desires; he
            dwells in the wilderness to withdraw from sinful creatures and strengthen his relationship with God; he
            robes himself in animal skins to live in simple poverty. Stripping himself of all worldly comforts, he shows
            the Israelites a complete alienation from all that they naturally seek and calls them to seek God and his
            holiness instead.</p>
        <p>John the Baptist proclaims a double message: wash yourselves in the waters of repentance for your sins, but
            know that it is not enough. Begging for forgiveness is only the beginning. What we must yearn for is not
            merely to live a normal human life with less sin; God has placed a deeper desire within our hearts to walk
            with him and to be transformed into his perfect image and likeness. This is what we have lost due to sin.
            This must be the real motive for our repentance.</p>
        <p>St. John also announces the good news of the One who will come after him, One greater than he who will
            transform us by baptizing us into Divine life. Our great penance is to prepare us to meet the One who comes
            after John. It is an expression not just of repentance for our sins but, even more, of our longing to be
            lifted up into union with God.</p>
        <p>So let us fast intensely today. Let us withdraw quietly into our hearts, withdrawing especially from
            distracting, superficial relationships, and let us pray with John in repentance for our failings, but even
            more, that we may yearn for a transforming union with God. Let us receive our ashes, but may those ashes be
            a sign not just of sorrow for sin but also of our yearning for transforming union with God.</p>
        <p>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

        <h2>Today's Action Item</h2>
        <p><i>Build your Fraternity.</i> As men, we are made for communion, which breaks us out of spiritual isolation.
            Great
            transformations are not won on our own but happen only with and through others. This remains true for making
            a fruitful Lent. We need support, especially as we battle in the desert with Christ. Exodus Men who have
            experienced transformation consistently give abundant credit to the great fraternity they built along the
            way. Those who have set time aside for fraternity regularly report how they have become a greater source of
            grace to their families.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Within your fraternity, each man should pair up with a brother. This particular brother is now your anchor,
            and you are his. If there is an odd number, make it a group of three. The two (or three) of you should check
            in daily. This should usually be a brief meeting or phone call, but on a busy day, a text conversation is
            acceptable.</p>
        <p>Commit to living the life the Lord is calling all men to, which includes the commitment to living fraternity.
            In addition to staying faithful to your weekly meetings, here are three optional but proven recommendations
            for strengthening your fraternity:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Consider scheduling a weekly fraternity holy hour. Your daily holy hours can be done on your own, but
                coming into the presence of the Lord as a fraternity has a mysterious unifying effect.</li>
            <li>Go to confession regularly as a fraternity. Regular confession every few weeks is a great way to renew
                your brotherly bonds, both with your fraternity and with Christ.</li>
            <li>Attend one extra Mass with your fraternity each week. Past Exodus fraternities have found that attending
                an extra Mass each week worked best when a consistent day of the week was chosen. Many fraternities
                paired their weekly Mass with their fraternity holy hour before or after Mass.</li>
        </ol>
