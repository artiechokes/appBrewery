        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>

        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>

        <p><b>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</b> Remember the glory that God has called you to, how you have
            fallen from that glory, and how much you depend on his saving help.</p>

        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>
        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>

        <h2>A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p>And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed.
            And Simon and those who were with him followed him, and they found him and said to him, "Every one is
            searching for you." And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for
            that is why I came out." And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out
            demons. And a leper came to him begging him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean."
            Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be clean." And
            immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at
            once, and said to him, "See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer
            for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to the people." But he went out and began to talk
            freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in
            the country; and people came to him from every quarter.</p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>Adam and Eve had fallen, and even their relationship to their own bodies was broken. Their bodies did what
            they did not want to do, and in the end, the body would do what they did not want the most: the body would
            die. Leprosy, a walking death, was a symbol of that rupture between the soul and body caused by sin, of the
            doomed destiny of each person. In leprosy, the flesh decayed and fell off so that his body seemed like a
            corpse even before he died. It was repulsive, and it recalled with unrelenting clarity the final end of all
            our struggles. It raised fear in everyone who saw it because it was the destiny of their bodies as well. The
            leper's cry may very well have been like the cry of St. Paul, "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me
            from this body of death" (Romans 7:24)?</p>

        <p>And this dark destiny was the result of Adam's rejection of his purpose. His soul was not strong enough to
            resist the seductive lies of the devil and to simply trust God and bend his will to God's commands. God made
            Adam in his own image and established him in his friendship. He was to live in submission to Godâ€”trusting
            him, depending upon him, and obeying him. But Adam, and every sinner since Adam, has rejected that vocation,
            and so each of us finds ourselves unable to make our bodies and our wills always live and act as we would
            want. We have bodies of death, and not vessels of honor and grace.</p>

        <p>But Christ came to restore this divine life in us. He wants to bring us, the walking dead, back to life and
            reestablish us in his friendship. But how? By his wonderful plan of love and sacrifice, foreshadowed by the
            sacrifice that Moses commanded for the cure of leprosy. For Moses ordered that to be cleansed, a leper must
            bring two birds to the priest. One bird would be sacrificed over running water. The living bird would be
            dipped into the blood of the dead bird and this blood the priest would then sprinkle over the leper seven
            times and pronounce him clean, and the living bird would be set free (see Leviticus 14:1-7). In order to
            save the human race, now walking in the leprosy of sin, Christ, in his great compassion, willingly
            sacrificed his life. His blood, through the waters of baptism, washes over us and divine life is restored to
            our souls.</p>

        <p>Only then are we set free to fulfill God's glorious purpose for our lives.</p>

        <p>Christ has come to restore us. To be with us. To cleanse us by the blood of his suffering and death on the
            cross offered to his Father to satisfy in his own flesh for our sins. Let us stir up our gratitude. Let us
            spend time today thanking the Father for his forgiveness, thanking the Son for his love and suffering. And
            let us pray that throughout this Lent, we will be ever more renewed in the divine life that he has, at such
            a great cost, restored to us. </p>

        <h2>Today's Action Item</h2>

        <p><b>Observe Sunday as a Little Easter. </b> Lent is actually forty-six days. We speak of forty days in the
            desert with Christ because we do not count the six Sundays between Ash Wednesday and Easter as a part of
            Lent. Every Sunday celebrates the resurrection. For this reason, Sunday is not a day of fasting in the
            Church's tradition, and during this Lenten exercise, we have a mitigation of our disciplines.</p>

        <p>The Church's liturgical life draws together an annual cycle of fasting and feasting. Lent, of course, focuses
            primarily on asceticism, but as we grow in discipline, we should be able to enter more deeply into true
            festivity and celebration. Without stopping our spiritual exercises, we enter into the joy of holy days and
            honor them through our prayer and, on the most solemn days, by lightening our disciplines. </p>

        <p>Each Sunday is a little Easter on which we remember and celebrate the Lord's Day, the day of the Lord's
            Resurrection. Every Sunday, therefore, your fraternity is permitted to relax one discipline together to
            remind you of the glory of God and anticipation of the joy of Easter. Choose one discipline to relax as a
            fraternity to preserve fraternal unity and accountability. It is strongly advised that you do not relax
            technology-related disciplines. </p>

        <p>As we progress in Lent, there are two solemnities (in addition to Sundays) that call for celebration: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Saint Joseph's Day, Patron of Exodus 90, on Monday, March 20th</li>
            <li>The Annunciation of the Lord on Saturday, March 25th</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These days will follow the same principle, allowing for the relaxation of one discipline as set by the
            fraternity. Our Lenten asceticism should enable us to enter into the joy of the Lord to express true
            spiritual joy in prayer and leisure. </p>
