        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            Christ is preparing us to encounter him in his Paschal Mystery in Jerusalem.
            Jesus invites us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And they came to Bethsa′ida. And some people brought to him a blind man, and begged him to touch him. And
                he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and
                laid his hands upon him, he asked him, “Do you see anything?” And he looked up and said, “I see men; but
                they look like trees, walking.” Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and
                was restored, and saw everything clearly. And he sent him away to his home, saying, “Do not even enter
                the village.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>After returning to Galilee, Jesus gives sight to a blind, Jewish man.
            Here is a man who knows the revelation of the Old Covenant; he knows what God has done for his people.
            But he is a man who has lost his sight: he remembers what trees and men look like, but he has lost his
            vision.
            He does not see the point of his life now, or how all his suffering and toil are a part of God’s plan.
            He does not yet perceive God’s plan to redeem us and make us partakers of his divinity. </p>
        <p>There are two stages to how the blind man is brought to see the face of Christ: first he sees imperfectly, as
            if he sees that Christ is not like the other men around.
            He sees “trees walking”; that is, he sees a man acting well beyond the capacity of any man.
            But he does not yet clearly see who Jesus is.
            Indeed, for Mark, we cannot fully see that until we are able to gaze upon Christ crucified.
            Only then can we fully know who he is.
            And so the blind man is brought through two healings: first to perceive the miracles and wonders of Jesus,
            and then, when he looks more intently, to see into the depths more clearly.</p>
        <p>So too for us: we must look not only to the “highs” of our faith journey: the experiences of joy and
            confidence.
            We must accustom ourselves to look more intently to recognize Jesus in our struggles and sufferings.
            This happens when we allow Jesus to touch our hearts.
            As Pope Francis writes:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>The light of love is born when our hearts are touched and we open ourselves to the interior presence of
                the beloved, who enables us to recognize his mystery.
                Thus we can understand why, together with hearing and seeing, Saint John can speak of faith as touch, as
                he says in his First Letter: ‘What we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes and touched with our
                hands, concerning the word of life’ (1 John 1:1). By his taking flesh and coming among us, Jesus has
                touched us, and through the sacraments he continues to touch us even today; transforming our hearts, he
                unceasingly enables us to acknowledge and acclaim him as the Son of God. In faith, we can touch him and
                receive the power of his grace. To touch him with our hearts: that is what it means to believe. (Lumen
                Fidei, #31)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A crowd brings the blind man to Jesus, but it seems none of them touch Jesus with personal faith, a faith
            that apprehends the mystery that he is the Son who reveals the Father.
            Jesus must lead the blind man away out of the village, and touching him, molds the man to himself, so that
            he may receive the faith needed to see and understand who Jesus is.</p>
        <p>Today, on this Fifth Sunday of Lent ask Jesus to touch you in his Sacrament of Love, and to deepen your gaze
            of faith so that you may see ever more clearly who Jesus is and who he wants to transform you to be.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2 id="week-4-action-items">Week 4 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Embrace silence.</li>
            <li>Be diligent.</li>
            <li>Stay faithful to your brothers.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Embrace silence.</strong>
            God brings about our transformation through prayer.
            We need to prioritize silent time with him each day.
            Missing prayer time can seem just like passing by a gas station exit on the highway.
            It's passed before we even realize it.
            If you want to become a holier man, put on the brakes to make time for the source of all grace
            and life: Jesus Christ. <br>The disciplines don’t mean much if our hearts and minds aren’t being led in the
            right direction
            in silent prayer.
            Let the Word of God lead you through this desert each day.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Be diligent.</strong>
            Stay the course by trading desserts for spiritual diligence.
            Keep up all your efforts to the end.
            Christ has great things in mind for you.<br>As you continue to maintain discipline through penance and
            exercise, be sure not to waste the
            opportunity to offer these difficulties for your past sins.
            Embrace this opportunity, this time of renewal. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Stay faithful to your brothers.</strong>
            They need you and you need them regardless of whether or not everyone in your fraternity
            believes this.
            Show up to your weekly fraternity meeting, be truthful, and let God do the rest. </p>
