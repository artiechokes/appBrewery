        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            Christ is preparing us to encounter him in his Paschal Mystery in Jerusalem.
            Jesus invites us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the
                region of the Decapolis. And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech;
                and they besought him to lay his hand upon him. And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he
                put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed,
                and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” And his ears were opened, his tongue was released,
                and he spoke plainly. And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more
                zealously they proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things
                well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>After healing the Syrophoenician woman’s daughter, Jesus comes to her native land, the land associated with
            Baal in the Old Testament and with Greek apostasy in the New Testament.<br>He finds there a man who has
            never heard the words of Moses; he has never encountered the revelation of God in any way.
            He is not just deaf and dumb physically, as he is also unaware of the revealed Word of God. </p>
        <p>Jesus could have revealed himself secretly in the stillness of the man’s heart.
            Faith is indeed an interior reality as we have seen this week, but faith also measures our interior thoughts
            against an objective measurement.
            If faith were only an emotional, subjective disposition to God, there would be no need for external
            teaching, no need for a written book of Scripture or apostolic teachers.
            But God knows that in our brokenness we are too often willing to convince ourselves that our feelings are
            the inspiration of God; our misunderstandings and broken desires we may justify as signs of the divine will.
        </p>
        <p>We need Jesus not only to join himself to us interiorly, but also to provide us with a sure norm that we can
            follow and measure ourselves against.
            For this reason, the teachings of faith are written in Scripture and set forth in fixed clear terms by
            Church councils and wise teachers.
            As the Catechism of the Catholic Church notes: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>We do not believe in formulas, but in those realities they express, which faith allows us to touch. ‘The
                believer's act [of faith] does not terminate in the propositions, but in the realities [which they
                express].’
                All the same, we do approach these realities with the help of formulations of the faith which permit us
                to express the faith and to hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to assimilate and live on it more
                and more. (CCC, #170)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is why when Jesus heals the deaf man in the way he does.
            He reaches inside of him and enters into his affliction so as to plant the life of faith within his heart.
            At the same time, he opens his ears to be able to hear the external guides and teachings that will help his
            faith to grow, and he heals his tongue, making the man capable of expressing and embodying the interior life
            of faith he now receives. </p>
        <p>Today, spend a few minutes giving thanks to God for the external teachers of the faith that he has put into
            your life, and pray for the grace to respond well to their teaching.</p>

        <h2 id="week-4-action-items">Week 4 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Embrace silence.</li>
            <li>Be diligent.</li>
            <li>Stay faithful to your brothers.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Embrace silence.</strong>
            God brings about our transformation through prayer.
            We need to prioritize silent time with him each day.
            Missing prayer time can seem just like passing by a gas station exit on the highway.
            It's passed before we even realize it.
            If you want to become a holier man, put on the brakes to make time for the source of all grace
            and life: Jesus Christ. <br>The disciplines don’t mean much if our hearts and minds aren’t being led in the
            right direction
            in silent prayer.
            Let the Word of God lead you through this desert each day.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Be diligent.</strong>
            Stay the course by trading desserts for spiritual diligence.
            Keep up all your efforts to the end.
            Christ has great things in mind for you.<br>As you continue to maintain discipline through penance and
            exercise, be sure not to waste the
            opportunity to offer these difficulties for your past sins.
            Embrace this opportunity, this time of renewal. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Stay faithful to your brothers.</strong>
            They need you and you need them regardless of whether or not everyone in your fraternity
            believes this.
            Show up to your weekly fraternity meeting, be truthful, and let God do the rest. </p>
