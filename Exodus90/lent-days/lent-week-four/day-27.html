        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in
            the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting
            your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer
            for transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            As we continue to follow Christ, we find ourselves constantly going back and forth in our
            relationship with God.
            At times, we find ourselves in a familiar setting, relating to the God we know, resting in
            traditions and customs that comfort and console us.
            At other times we are confronted by something new and challenging: we begin to understand our
            faults and failings anew, and are challenged to grow in new ways. God wants us in this
            borderland.
            It is where Jesus kept his disciples as he prepared them to encounter his Paschal Mystery.
            And so we follow the disciples and Christ, at times journeying through the familiar areas of
            Judea, repeating the customs of Lent that we expect, and at other times, we set out into pagan
            lands to discover our need for renewed conversion.
            In this back and forth, we need to stay focused on Christ.
            Until now we have been thinking of the works we are doing to be transformed: prayer, fasting,
            and almsgiving.
            Now we want to turn our attention to the activities we can do that are a sharing in Christ’s
            inner life.
            Jesus wants us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during
            this season of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>Now when the Pharisees gathered together to him, with some of the scribes, who had come from
                Jerusalem, they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands defiled, that is, unwashed.
                For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands, observing the
                tradition of the elders; and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless
                they purify themselves; and there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing
                of cups and pots and vessels of bronze. And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do
                your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with hands
                defiled?” And he said to them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is
                written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do
                they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’ You leave the commandment of
                God, and hold fast the tradition of men.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>The story in today’s reading is almost comical: Jesus has just miraculously fed 5,000 men, with
            twelve baskets of food left over.
            And the only thing that the Pharisees can say is, you didn’t wash your hands before you ate.
            What incredible blindness!
            What a willful refusal to acknowledge what has happened right before their eyes!</p>
        <p>Here we see an hypocrisy that is an obstacle to true faith.
            The Pharisees had received the commandments of God that they were to meditate upon day and
            night.
            The people of the Mosaic covenant accepted the law because it was revealed by God who is truth
            itself.
            But for this faith is to be living and active, the people needed to understand what had been
            revealed.
            The Pharisees were well-known experts in the law and held themselves to be more scrupulous in
            keeping the law. </p>
        <p>But at some point in the history of the Jewish people, many of the Pharisees lost sight of God
            and his loving will and began to delight more in themselves and their own prestige and power to
            create legal traditions among the Jews.
            Washing of hands is a case in point: nowhere in the law does God specify that all Jews must
            ritually wash before eating.
            The Pharisees, however, had extended the priestly requirement to eat in ritual purity to all of
            Israel as a way of demonstrating the link between all eating and eating in connection with
            Temple worship. </p>
        <p>Those Pharisees who had developed this aspect of the law were delighted by themselves and their
            own power.
            If their faith had been rooted in humble obedience to God, they would have been able to
            recognize Jesus as the Son of God and marvel at his teaching and miracles.
            But because their faith had become more about themselves than about God, they were unable to
            respond to the revelation of Christ.</p>
        <p>As we submit to our disciplines and rules of life, we must always remember that those external
            actions are not a replacement for the love of God and obedience to the will of God.
            Pope Francis writes, “Believing means entrusting oneself to a merciful love... which sustains
            and directs our lives.... Faith consists in the willingness to let ourselves be constantly
            transformed and renewed by God’s call” (Lumen Fidei, #13).
            The personal, intimate relationship with God that he has given us is the essence of our faith.
            We must always keep in mind that it is God who sustains our life of faith and not merely our own
            thoughts and efforts. </p>

        <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

        <h2 id="week-4-action-items">Week 4 Action Items</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Embrace silence.</strong>
            God brings about our transformation through prayer.
            We need to prioritize silent time with him each day.
            Missing prayer time can seem just like passing by a gas station exit on the highway.
            It's passed before we even realize it.
            If you want to become a holier man, put on the brakes to make time for the source of all grace
            and life: Jesus Christ. <br>The disciplines don’t mean much if our hearts and minds aren’t being led in the
            right direction
            in silent prayer.
            Let the Word of God lead you through this desert each day.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Be diligent.</strong>
            Stay the course by trading desserts for spiritual diligence.
            Keep up all your efforts to the end.
            Christ has great things in mind for you.<br>As you continue to maintain discipline through penance and
            exercise, be sure not to waste the
            opportunity to offer these difficulties for your past sins.
            Embrace this opportunity, this time of renewal. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Stay faithful to your brothers.</strong>
            They need you and you need them regardless of whether or not everyone in your fraternity
            believes this.
            Show up to your weekly fraternity meeting, be truthful, and let God do the rest. </p>
