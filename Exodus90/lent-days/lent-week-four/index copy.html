        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in
            the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting
            your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer
            for transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            Christ is preparing us to encounter him in his Paschal Mystery in Jerusalem.
            Jesus invites us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during
            this season of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his
                disciples to him, and said to them, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now
                three
                days, and have nothing to eat; and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the
                way; and some of them have come a long way.” And his disciples answered him, “How can one feed these men
                with bread here in the desert?” And he asked them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, “Seven.” And
                he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks
                he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the
                crowd. And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be
                set before them. And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven
                baskets full. And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away; and immediately he got
                into the boat with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanu′tha. The Pharisees came and began
                to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit,
                and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this
                generation.” And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.
            </em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Jesus works the miracle of the loaves and fish a second time, this time in the land of the Gentiles. In the
            land of the twelve tribes of Israel, he fed the multitudes with twelve baskets left over as a sign of his
            messianic restoration of the kingdom of Israel. Now he feeds the four thousand and has seven baskets left
            over. Seven is the number that recalls creation, for it was in seven days that God created the heavens and
            the earth. In feeding the Gentiles, Jesus is promising not only to restore Israel, but to restore all
            mankind to the glory for which it was destined at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Letting us see creation with the eyes of faith is part of that restoration. When Adam laid his eyes upon the
            newly created world he knew first and foremost that each thing brought to him was a gift from God intended
            to help Adam express his inner relationship with God. Adam’s loving relationship with God was itself an
            experience of truth that opened his eyes to see in union with his beloved Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
            Christ, in the days after restoring hearing to the pagan man, now restores the Gentiles to a communion with
            him—inviting them to eat with him and share in his life and vision, and inviting them into a new covenant of
            mutual faithfulness to each other.
        </p>
        <p>Pope Francis writes:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>Because faith-knowledge is linked to the covenant with a faithful God who enters into
                a relationship of love with man and speaks his word to him, the Bible presents it as a form of hearing …
                Knowledge linked to a word is always personal knowledge; it recognizes the voice of the one speaking,
                opens
                up to that person in freedom and follows him or her in obedience. Paul could thus speak of the
                ‘obedience of
                faith’ (cf. Romans 1:5; 16:26). Faith is also a knowledge bound to the passage of time, for words take
                time
                to be pronounced, and it is a knowledge assimilated only along a journey of discipleship. The experience
                of
                hearing can thus help to bring out more clearly the bond between knowledge and love. (Lumen Fidei, #29)
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The Pharisees, lacking a loving relationship, are blind to the obvious signs that God is working in Jesus
            Christ. They ask him for a sign, and Jesus sighs deeply and refuses to give them another sign, knowing that
            they are unwilling to see and believe.
        </p>
        <p>In our Lenten journey, Christ invites us to fast, pray and give alms, so that we can learn to deny ourselves
            and strengthen our spiritual communion with him. He also asks us to receive his sacred body given to us in
            Word and sacrament, so he can nourish our loving union with him. Let us hear him as Adam heard God speak in
            the garden. Today, pray for an increase in faith that you may render more loving obedience as you strive to
            better express your faith in your daily life.</p>

        <h2 id="week-4-action-items">Week 4 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Embrace silence.</li>
            <li>Be diligent.</li>
            <li>Stay faithful to your brothers.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Embrace silence.</strong>
            God brings about our transformation through prayer.
            We need to prioritize silent time with him each day.
            Missing prayer time can seem just like passing by a gas station exit on the highway.
            It's passed before we even realize it.
            If you want to become a holier man, put on the brakes to make time for the source of all grace
            and life: Jesus Christ. <br>The disciplines don’t mean much if our hearts and minds aren’t being led in the
            right direction
            in silent prayer.
            Let the Word of God lead you through this desert each day.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Be diligent.</strong>
            Stay the course by trading desserts for spiritual diligence.
            Keep up all your efforts to the end.
            Christ has great things in mind for you.<br>As you continue to maintain discipline through penance and
            exercise, be sure not to waste the
            opportunity to offer these difficulties for your past sins.
            Embrace this opportunity, this time of renewal. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Stay faithful to your brothers.</strong>
            They need you and you need them regardless of whether or not everyone in your fraternity
            believes this.
            Show up to your weekly fraternity meeting, be truthful, and let God do the rest. </p>
