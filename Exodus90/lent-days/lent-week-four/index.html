        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the borderland between Gentile and Jew.</strong>
            Christ is preparing us to encounter him in his Paschal Mystery in Jerusalem.
            Jesus invites us to share in his own knowledge of God, to be transformed through faith.
            As we enter into the unknown, let us renew and deepen our faith in Christ.
            Let us be transformed.</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. And he cautioned
                them, saying, “Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” And they
                discussed it with one another, saying, “We have no bread.” And being aware of it, Jesus said to them,
                “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your
                hearts hardened? Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?
                When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take
                up?” They said to him, “Twelve.” “And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken
                pieces did you take up?” And they said to him, “Seven.” And he said to them, “Do you not yet
                understand?”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>When we have an experience, we generally reflect on it.
            That’s what humans do.
            We may reflect more or less well, and we may or may not learn the right lessons, but experience always
            teaches us something when we think about what happens to us.
            When Christ became man, he chose to learn by experience.
            He knew all things from eternity in his divine mind, and his human mind received the fullness of that
            revelation from God; but he also still grew in wisdom by learning things experientially.
            When the hemorrhaging woman touched him, he asked who had touched him so he could experience physically
            seeing her whose faith he knew interiorly.
            So it should be no surprise that Jesus expects us to reflect upon our own experience of faith.
            And when we do that, we are engaging in theology: faith seeking further understanding.</p>
        <p>Pope Francis writes: </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>Faith... draws us into itself, inviting us... better to know the object of our love. Christian theology
                is born of this desire. Clearly, theology… is part of the very process of faith, which seeks an ever
                deeper understanding of God’s self-disclosure culminating in Christ. It follows that theology is more
                than simply an effort of human reason to analyze and understand, along the lines of the experimental
                sciences. God cannot be reduced to an object. He is a subject who makes himself known and perceived in
                an interpersonal relationship. Right faith orients reason to open itself to the light which comes from
                God, so that reason, guided by love of the truth, can come to a deeper knowledge of God... [This] is a
                participation in God’s own knowledge of himself. It is not just our discourse about God, but first and
                foremost the acceptance and the pursuit of a deeper understanding of the word which God speaks to us,
                the word which God speaks about himself, for he is an eternal dialogue of communion, and he allows us to
                enter into this dialogue.... [We need] humility to be ‘touched’ by God, admitting [our] own limitations
                before the mystery, while striving to investigate the inexhaustible riches of this mystery. (Lumen
                Fidei, #36) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When we reflect on our experience of faith, we may do it badly.
            We may, like the Pharisees, come to rely more on our own thoughts and desires than on the foundations of
            faith, or we may, like the disciples in the boat, interpret our experiences in terms of merely earthly
            realities.
            Christ revealed his plan of divinizing redemption, and the disciples could only think about where to get
            more bread.
            So too, we can overshadow the light of faith by our earthly cares.
            During Lent, therefore, we try to think less about eating food and gaining money, and instead empty
            ourselves to receive spiritual gifts.</p>
        <p>Spend time today reflecting on your experience of faith so far during this Lent.
            Ask the Holy Spirit to help you hear what Christ is trying to tell you.</p>

        <h2 id="week-4-action-items">Week 4 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Embrace silence.</li>
            <li>Be diligent.</li>
            <li>Stay faithful to your brothers.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Embrace silence.</strong>
            God brings about our transformation through prayer.
            We need to prioritize silent time with him each day.
            Missing prayer time can seem just like passing by a gas station exit on the highway.
            It's passed before we even realize it.
            If you want to become a holier man, put on the brakes to make time for the source of all grace
            and life: Jesus Christ. <br>The disciplines don’t mean much if our hearts and minds aren’t being led in the
            right direction
            in silent prayer.
            Let the Word of God lead you through this desert each day.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Be diligent.</strong>
            Stay the course by trading desserts for spiritual diligence.
            Keep up all your efforts to the end.
            Christ has great things in mind for you.<br>As you continue to maintain discipline through penance and
            exercise, be sure not to waste the
            opportunity to offer these difficulties for your past sins.
            Embrace this opportunity, this time of renewal. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Stay faithful to your brothers.</strong>
            They need you and you need them regardless of whether or not everyone in your fraternity
            believes this.
            Show up to your weekly fraternity meeting, be truthful, and let God do the rest. </p>
