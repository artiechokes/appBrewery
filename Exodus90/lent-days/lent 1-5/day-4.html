        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>

        <p><b>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</b> Remember the glory that God has called you to, how you have
            fallen from that glory, and how much you depend on his saving help.</p>

        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>

        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>

        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>
        <h2>A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>

        <p><i>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching!
                With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
                And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee. And immediately
                he left the synagogue, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon's
                mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him of her. And he came and took her by
                the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her; and she served them. That evening, at sundown, they
                brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. And the whole city was gathered together
                about the door.</i></p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Even before their anxious toil began, Adam and Eve were confronted with another effect of their fall: they
            were immediately alienated from each other. Before, they had been completely present to each other, trusting
            and vulnerable with no shame; now they each hid part of themselves, fearful that the other would exploit or
            harm them, no longer only looking at them with love and a desire for mutual self-giving (cf. Gen. 2:25 and
            3:7). We all know the pain of mutual distrust or actual betrayal and abandonment that has damaged so many of
            our relationships. </p>
        <p>The Psalmist compares this alienation from our friends with the experience of sickness: </p>
        <blockquote><i>There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones
                because of my sin… My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand afar off
                (Psalms 38:3,11) </i></blockquote>

        <p>And the more intense the sickness, the more we experience the pain of isolation from our fellows. In fact,
            the anxiety we have about death is, in part, an anxiety about the total rupture of our relationships with
            friends and family: </p>

        <blockquote><i>For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol [the place of the dead]. I am
                reckoned among those who go down to the Pit; I am a man who has no strength, like one forsaken among the
                dead, like the slain that lie in the grave … You have caused loved one and friend to shun me; my
                companions are in darkness. (Psalms 88:3-5, 18) </i></blockquote>

        <p>Whether there is a physical, emotional, or mental sickness, or whether our ailment is in fact the rupturing
            of relationships, we have all known some taste of this isolation. </p>

        <p>But Jesus comes to us in our isolation. Simon's mother-in-law was alone in her bed. The others were praying
            at the synagogue; she could not witness Christ's authority over the demon and the power he had to free
            Israel from slavery to sin. But Christ came to the woman in her isolation, raised her from her bed and
            healed her, and brought her into the community of meaningful work. Her house becomes the place where the
            whole city gathers—relationships are being healed.</p>

        <p>Let Christ come into the areas of your life where you suffer from the pain of isolation, into those
            relationships that need to be healed. We began the Great Fast by begging for forgiveness of those around us;
            invite Jesus into that action, and ask him to heal all those relationships. He has come to free us from the
            effects of our sins, and that includes the pain of mistrust and suspicion. Let his healing begin to
            transform your love for your neighbors.</p>


        <p><i>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,
                consider using the <a

        <h2>Today's Action Item</h2>
        <p><b>Commit to Daily Prayer. </b> Lent is a perfect time to ask yourself, "what is the most important thing in
            my life?" It's a defining question, and nothing answers it more honestly than how we spend our time. Lent is
            a time of spiritual growth that relies on God's grace to enter into Christ's life: his prayer and battle in
            the desert. As part of this Lenten exercise, you're called to commit to a daily holy hour. How is it going
            so far?</p>

        <p>Archbishop Fulton Sheen reflects on the importance of a holy hour for change: "It reduces our liability to
            temptation and weakness... The Lord will be favorable even to the weakest of us, if He finds us at His feet
            in adoration, disposing ourselves to receive divine favors... Even the person who has fallen can expect
            reassurance if he watches and prays." If you desire transformation, then be committed to your daily time of
            silent prayer. Do not let yourself be persuaded into thinking that you have no time. You can do it. God will
            provide the grace for you if you show up to prayer each day, willing to receive it.</p>

        <p>In addition to the scripture and reflection offered by Exodus, the holy hour will be an experience of silent
            meditation and contemplation with the Lord. You are called to commit yourself to a daily holy hour, but if
            you can't do an entire holy hour on a given day, do as much as you can. Preserving twenty minutes of silent
            contemplative prayer is the exercise minimum on days you cannot make a full holy hour. When you are making
            the full holy hour, at least twenty minutes of silent contemplative prayer in open conversational time with
            God should be a part of the hour. Ideally, daily holy hours should be spent in Eucharistic adoration with
            our Eucharistic Lord exposed in a monstrance or reposed in a tabernacle. If neither option is available,
            then "go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees
            in secret will reward you" (Matthew 6:6).</p>

        <p>Exodus Men form a living fraternity. You can count on the prayers of your brothers. They will be praying for
            you, and you should be praying daily for them by name. Moreover, there are tens of thousands of Exodus Men
            around the world praying for you and for all Exodus Men. These are your brothers. They have endured the same
            grueling, purifying ninety days you are about to take up. They continue to "fight the good fight of faith"
            (1 Timothy 6:12) through their ongoing life of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity. So be encouraged. You and
            your fraternity are far from alone on this journey.</p>
