        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>

        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>

        <p><b>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</b> Remember the glory that God has called you to, how you have
            fallen from that glory, and how much you depend on his saving help.</p>

        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>

        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>

        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>

        <h2>A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>

        <p><i>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, "The time
                is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel." And passing along
                by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they
                were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men." And
                immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son
                of Zeb′edee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called
                them; and they left their father Zeb′edee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him. And
                they went into Caper′na-um; and immediately on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. And they
                were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
                And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, "What have
                you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of
                God." But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" And the unclean spirit,
                convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</i></p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>When Adam and Eve fell from grace in Eden, God gave them both the punishment of painful work: for Eve, God
            declared that she would conceive and bring forth children in toiling pain, and for Adam, God said that in
            toil and sweat he would bring forth bread from the earth (see Genesis 3:16-19). The Hebrew word is the same
            in both cases, iṣṣabon, and both times it implies not only physical discomfort and effort but also mental
            anguish and anxiety. It is a sign of the lack of harmony that now exists between man and the wider world: no
            longer are things like eating and bringing forth new life effortless. Instead, our life is a constant
            struggle, a fight for resources, success, recognition, and the rest. And it is doomed to failure. The last
            line of God's punishment reads, "In the [anxious] sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to
            the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return." Man's existence is a
            relentless battle with all aspects of life, and in the end, we will return to the dust we were made from.
            Why is man so anxious? No matter what he does, he will die. Even if he is successful in some venture, in the
            end he will still die. The author of Ecclesiastes takes this anxious toil as indicative of man's miserably
            vain condition: everything is pointless, because after a life of toil, we've earned only death.</p>

        <p>When Christ emerges from his own victorious struggle with temptation, the first thing he offers to Simon,
            Andrew, James, and John is relief from vain toil. He frees them from pointless labor and begins their
            training for a work they can be confident will endure: the work of proclaiming the new kingdom of God and
            capturing the hearts of men for their King. Immediately after he calls these disciples, Jesus enters a
            synagogue on the sabbath, that blessed day of rest from toil, and casts out a demon—the root of man's
            perpetual restlessness.</p>

        <p>This does not mean that Jesus brings us a life with no effort. Certainly not. But it does mean that he wants
            to transform our efforts into meaningful, enduring results. Whereas before, effort was always filled with a
            certain anxious fear because we knew there was a horizon that would reveal our work as a vain show, now our
            pains and anxieties and efforts can be free from captivity to the devil and free to serve an eternal King
            and his kingdom.</p>

        <p>"Repent," Jesus cries, echoing John the Baptist. But the repentance is coupled with belief in the good news
            of his coming victory; the labor of penance and of life is no longer a pointless exercise whereby earthly
            existence is possibly made a little better. Now penance is a divine work, undertaken with Christ. Let us
            therefore gladly undertake the work of our repentance, offering up our labors and sacrifices for our own
            sanctification and the sanctification of those we love.</p>

        <p><i>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,
                consider using the <a

        <h2>Today's Action Item</h2>
        <p><b>Embrace Asceticism.</b> Lent is a time of prayer and penance. Fridays in Lent are even more intense days
            when everyone is called to abstain from meat, and we focus our attention on the Passion of Christ. This
            exercise should help you to make the most of Lent by embracing asceticism, the practice of penance, and
            self-denial. The combination of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity leads to inner conversion through
            external acts to provide you with a framework for growth. Each discipline that you embrace this Lent will
            provide you with an offering to God for your good and for your family. The suffering of saying "no" to
            deserts and sweets may be difficult, but if you see that your "no" is really a "yes" offered to the Lord,
            then your mindset will change. This comes through uniting your sacrifice to the cross and prayerfully
            offering the sacrifice to the Lord for your specific intention.</p>

        <p>This Lenten exercise contains a <a href="../images/disciplines.png">specific list of ascetic disciplines.</a>
            As
            you review the list, you may notice
            that the disciplines touch most aspects of daily life. Some may be easy for you, while others will be more
            challenging. If some disciplines seem unnecessary because you don't struggle with them, commit to doing them
            anyway. If some seem too hard for you to handle, commit to those too. In both situations, the Lord has gifts
            he wants to give you through them as a whole by creating a spirit of docility and humility. The practice of
            asceticism is challenging. It is a sacrifice and a cross. Take up your cross this Lent and offer your whole
            life as a worthy sacrifice to the Lord, holding nothing back.</p>

        <p>The asceticism of these 40-plus days will prune us of our attachments and help us to focus on what is most
            important. It will provide us with a means of growing in inner strength by doing difficult things for the
            Lord. The exercises will provide us a means of making reparation for our sins, helping us to realize that
            our material attachments cannot satisfy us. In our dependence upon them, we act as if they could make us
            happy, but there is no amount of material pleasure that could ever bring us peace. We must turn to what can
            truly satisfy us in loving God and others. Our culture acts as if suffering should be avoided at all costs,
            but in making a sacrifice, we deliberately suffer for what is most important (as a soldier who suffers for
            his country). Of course, there is always a need for prudence. If there is something in your life that makes
            taking up one of the disciplines reckless or imprudent, don't take it up. Let your fraternity know of any
            disciplines you aren't able to practice so that you can live these forty days in the light, and your
            brothers can best hold you accountable.</p>
