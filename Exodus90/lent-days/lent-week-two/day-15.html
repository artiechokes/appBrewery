        <h1 class="section-header">Vocal Prayer</h1>
        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the
            daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to enter the
            sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and communion with
            the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And he said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on a stand?
                For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light.
                If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” And he said to them, “Take heed what you hear; the measure
                you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you. For to him who has will more be
                given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>St. John of Damascus writes: </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>Just as iron plunged in fire does not become fire by nature, but by union and burning and participation,
                so what is deified does not become God by nature, but by participation.
                I am not speaking of the flesh of the incarnate Son of God; for that is called God immutably by personal
                union and participation in the divine nature. . . . By deification the saints are gods, it is said, that
                ‘God stands in the company of the gods.’</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>God stands in the company of the gods, that is, he is with deified souls who participate in the grace of
            Christ through prayer.
            The more we grow in prayer, the more we grow in sharing in the sonship and grace of Jesus Christ.
            But this blazing fire of grace needs to be kindled, and it is kindled by God giving kindling in proportion
            to the measure we open ourselves to him: “the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more
            will be given you.
            For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”
            We must be clear: we do nothing to earn his grace; it is freely given.
            But to the extent or measure we commit to regular prayer, to standing before God present in our hearts, with
            that measure God will generously bestow himself into us.
            But to the extent that we neglect the divine spark of sanctifying grace within us, to that extent our
            negligence will finally cause even that spark to be extinguished. </p>
        <p>We can begin by offering daily vocal prayer to God—either prayers that we create, or prayers received from
            scripture and tradition—and we may do this privately or with others.
            In whatever way we do it, we must always be attentive to what we are saying; our minds must mean the words
            we pray, and we must mean them as our own words, words arising from our own desires.
            We must be attentive to the fact that we are speaking to God within our hearts, even as we use our mouths to
            make the sounds. </p>
        <p>As we undertake this vocal prayer, let us remind ourselves that we stand before the awesome God, and that we
            are sinful creatures who he has condescended to save.
            Yet, we should also call to mind his extravagant gratuitous love for us; he has planted the light of his
            grace in our hearts.
            In vocal prayer we submerge ourselves in that light, entering into its hidden depths and allowing our tongue
            to declare, our eyes to see, and our ears to hear his presence within us.</p>
        <p>Today, stand before God. Be attentive to him who dwells within you, and as you say your vocal prayer aloud,
            shining the light of God’s presence for all to see, and receiving grace without proportion to the meager
            measure of your words.</p>

        <h2 id="week-2-action-items">Week 2 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</li>
            <li>Give up in order to give.</li>
            <li>Be a well set anchor.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>1. Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</strong>
            In our prayer, fasting, and giving we are seeking to be like Christ.
            We can speak about imitating him, but this is more than copying.
            When we enter our holy hour, we enter into Christ’s own prayer and become interiorly conformed to him,
            joined to his own love for the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            In our sacrifices, we are not just giving things up to be tough.
            We are learning to love like Christ, putting the Father before all else.
            Be both the one who offers the sacrifice for others and the sacrifice itself.</p>
        <p>Everything we give up is ordered toward relationship with God.
            We make sacrifices to spend time with those who are important to us.
            Get up earlier, give up your lunch break, do what it takes to make time for God.
            Stay focused on the goal of union with God in all that we do this Lent. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give up in order to give.</strong>
            Giving alms is a pillar of Lent for a reason.
            Nothing material in this world can completely satisfy a man.
            God gives us good things not to please us but to use for the good of others.
            Lent is a season of increased almsgiving, of greater attention to those in need.
            Make sacrifices for God and he will satisfy you.
            If you sacrifice unnecessary spending, you will be able to give more to others. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Be a well set anchor.</strong>
            The Christian life is made up of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            If you live prayer and asceticism, but not fraternity, you’re doing something, but you’re not living the
            fullness of the Christian life.
            Lean in and build a bond with your brothers.</p>
        <p>A key part of fraternity is being a good anchor.
            Stay honest with your anchor on how you are doing every day.
            Call him on to be honest and regular in his check-ins with you as well.
            Be a dependable, well set anchor.</p>
