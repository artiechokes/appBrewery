        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the
            daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to enter the
            sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and communion with
            the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>

        <p><em>And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? It is
                like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on
                earth; yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large
                branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.” With many such parables he spoke
                the word to them, as they were able to hear it; he did not speak to them without a parable, but
                privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>A great teacher of prayer of the 20th century, Matthew the Poor, writes, “Very few people spend any time
            practicing being with God. Fewer still enjoy the great blessing, by God’s grace, of interior prayer.
            Interior prayer is the fruit of the spiritual life.
            It is a return of Adam to the beauty of his former spirituality.”
            As with vocal prayer and meditation, there is no clear-cut boundary between meditation and the interior
            prayer of contemplation.
            One easily and naturally grows into the other.
            Indeed, the early monks who wrote about the habit of prayerful reading of scripture called <em>lectio
                divina</em> recommended a clear progression: begin by reading a scriptural passage. Before reading, say
            a brief vocal prayer to invite the Spirit into your time of prayer, and then read the passage slowly and
            meditatively.
            At some point you may be prompted to pray various vocal prayers in response to the passage.
            Then, after you consider the words during your time of meditation, make sure to allow for a time to just sit
            with God in silence, or, if not in complete silence, to slowly repeat a word or word of prayer over and
            over, perhaps just the name of Jesus or “Jesus have mercy on me.”</p>
        <p>In this silent, or nearly silent phase, allow yourself to be present with God.
            The divine presence will grow imperceptibly within you until all of your thoughts and feelings take shelter
            within it, as a bird nesting in the shade of a mustard shrub.
            It may not happen every time you sit down for prayer, but this invitation to contemplation is always
            available. </p>
        <p>God is present within our hearts, but for most of our experience, this presence is imperceptible.
            As St. Augustine puts it:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>You were within, and I without, and there did I seek You; I, unlovely, rushed heedlessly among the things
                of beauty You made.
                You were with me, but I was not with You.
                Those things kept me far from You, which, unless they were in You, were not.
                You called, and cried aloud, and forced open my deafness.
                You gleamed and shine, and chase away my blindness.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As we turn inward, we will discover Love itself awaiting us with open arms.</p>
        <p>We need to realize that this incredible outpouring of the experience of God is not just for the rare mystic
            or the exceptionally holy hermit.
            This experience of God hidden within us that can pervade our internal life is the kingdom of God, a kingdom
            opened to each of us by our baptism. </p>
        <p>Take time today, therefore, to sit in silence, or even to just repeat the name of Jesus, turning all your
            attention to the previously unnoticed mustard seed of his divine presence that God wishes to grow within
            your soul.</p>

        <h2 id="week-2-action-items">Week 2 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</li>
            <li>Give up in order to give.</li>
            <li>Be a well set anchor.</li>
        </ol>

        <br><br>
        <p><strong>1. Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</strong>
            In our prayer, fasting, and giving we are seeking to be like Christ.
            We can speak about imitating him, but this is more than copying.
            When we enter our holy hour, we enter into Christ’s own prayer and become interiorly conformed to him,
            joined to his own love for the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            In our sacrifices, we are not just giving things up to be tough.
            We are learning to love like Christ, putting the Father before all else.
            Be both the one who offers the sacrifice for others and the sacrifice itself.</p>
        <p>Everything we give up is ordered toward relationship with God.
            We make sacrifices to spend time with those who are important to us.
            Get up earlier, give up your lunch break, do what it takes to make time for God.
            Stay focused on the goal of union with God in all that we do this Lent. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give up in order to give.</strong>
            Giving alms is a pillar of Lent for a reason.
            Nothing material in this world can completely satisfy a man.
            God gives us good things not to please us but to use for the good of others.
            Lent is a season of increased almsgiving, of greater attention to those in need.
            Make sacrifices for God and he will satisfy you.
            If you sacrifice unnecessary spending, you will be able to give more to others. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Be a well set anchor.</strong>
            The Christian life is made up of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            If you live prayer and asceticism, but not fraternity, you’re doing something, but you’re not living the
            fullness of the Christian life.
            Lean in and build a bond with your brothers.</p>
        <p>A key part of fraternity is being a good anchor.
            Stay honest with your anchor on how you are doing every day.
            Call him on to be honest and regular in his check-ins with you as well.
            Be a dependable, well set anchor.</p>
