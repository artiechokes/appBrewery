        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            We are now two weeks into our journey and we are surrounded by the wilderness of Galilee. Like the
            disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the daily
            weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to renew ourselves
            by entering into Christ’s prayer and making it our own.</p>
        <p>Jesus has revealed to us the mystery of who he is, and who he wants us to be. He has led us to detach
            ourselves from things that give us comfort so as to better cling to him. Now he invites us to go deeper, to
            enter the sacred silence that is his own prayer—to share in his own longing for our sanctification and a
            share in his communion with the Father—and this prayer will radically transform us. Come, brothers, let us
            be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h2 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p><em>Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a
                boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land. And he taught them
                many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as
                he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. Other seed fell on rocky
                ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; and
                when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away. Other seed fell among
                thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. And other seeds fell into good
                soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a
                hundredfold.” And he said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</em></p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>Jesus both sows the seed, is the seed, and receives the seed. This is the marvelous mystery of Jesus Christ,
            true God and true man. As God, he reveals himself to mankind. And as God the Word he is the word sent from
            the Father into the hearts of all believers. He is God’s own revelation of himself, and he himself is the
            fullness of God’s revelation. And as man, Jesus must receive the gift of revelation.
            This last point takes a little to grasp. God, in his divine nature, has a divine mind. In his divine mind he
            knows himself and all that he is going to do. But in addition to his divine mind, the Second Person of the
            Trinity assumed a human mind when he assumed a human nature. As the Catechism states,
            “This human soul that the Son of God assumed is endowed with a true human knowledge. As such, this knowledge
            could not in itself be unlimited: it was exercised in the historical conditions of his existence in space
            and time. This is why the Son of God could, when he became man, “increase in wisdom and in stature, and in
            favor with God and man," and would even have to inquire for himself about what one in the human condition
            can learn only from experience” (CCC, 472).
            But the human mind of Christ was not cut off from his divine mind by a wall of separation. As the Catechism
            explains,
            This truly human knowledge of God's Son expressed the divine life of his person. "The human nature of God's
            Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and showed forth in itself everything that pertains
            to God." Such is first of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son of God made
            man has of his Father. The Son in his human knowledge also showed the divine penetration he had into the
            secret thoughts of human hearts. By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word incarnate,
            Christ enjoyed in his human knowledge the fullness of understanding of the eternal plans he had come to
            reveal. (CCC, 473-474)
            Jesus’ human mind, however, only shared in the divine knowledge through the gift of revelation. The human
            mind of its own cannot know the Father, or the Father’s eternal plans, or the secret thoughts of other
            hearts. All this knowledge only comes as a gift of revelation. Therefore, Jesus, in his divine nature
            reveals and is God’s Word, but in his human nature he receives this gift of revelation. He receives this
            revelation not for his own sake, but to share it with us.
            Today spend time in prayer asking Jesus to share his word with you. Ask him to help you hear it and let it
            take root in your mind just as it took root in his. He came so that we could share in his knowledge of God.
            Ask him for that gift.</p>

        <h2 id="week-2-action-items">Week 2 Action Items</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</strong>
            In our prayer, fasting, and giving we are seeking to be like Christ.
            We can speak about imitating him, but this is more than copying.
            When we enter our holy hour, we enter into Christ’s own prayer and become interiorly conformed to him,
            joined to his own love for the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            In our sacrifices, we are not just giving things up to be tough.
            We are learning to love like Christ, putting the Father before all else.
            Be both the one who offers the sacrifice for others and the sacrifice itself.</p>
        <p>Everything we give up is ordered toward relationship with God.
            We make sacrifices to spend time with those who are important to us.
            Get up earlier, give up your lunch break, do what it takes to make time for God.
            Stay focused on the goal of union with God in all that we do this Lent. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give up in order to give.</strong>
            Giving alms is a pillar of Lent for a reason.
            Nothing material in this world can completely satisfy a man.
            God gives us good things not to please us but to use for the good of others.
            Lent is a season of increased almsgiving, of greater attention to those in need.
            Make sacrifices for God and he will satisfy you.
            If you sacrifice unnecessary spending, you will be able to give more to others. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Be a well set anchor.</strong>
            The Christian life is made up of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            If you live prayer and asceticism, but not fraternity, you’re doing something, but you’re not living the
            fullness of the Christian life.
            Lean in and build a bond with your brothers.</p>
        <p>A key part of fraternity is being a good anchor.
            Stay honest with your anchor on how you are doing every day.
            Call him on to be honest and regular in his check-ins with you as well.
            Be a dependable, well set anchor.</p>
