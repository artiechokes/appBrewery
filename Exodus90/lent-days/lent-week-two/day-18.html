        <h1 class="section-header">Prayer in the Storm</h1>

        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings
            for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and
            the daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to
            enter the sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and
            communion with the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this
            season of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.” And
                leaving the crowd, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with
                him. And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already
                filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him,
                “Teacher, do you not care if we perish?” And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,
                “Peace! Be still!” And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, “Why are you
                afraid? Have you no faith?” And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, “Who then is
                this, that even wind and sea obey him?”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Our discussion of Christ’s grace and the various degrees of prayer may give the impression that praying
            with and in Christ is something that we do only in quiet retreat from daily life.
            And certainly, Jesus stresses in his parables that we must turn inward, we must encounter God hidden
            within us, the seed of grace with its transformative power implanted by our baptism and desirous of
            growing into the mature fruit of sanctity. </p>
        <p>But in relating his deeply interior parables so full of meaning, Jesus reminds us that he brought his
            grace into the midst of our anxious toil so that sharing in his prayer, he might transform our daily
            lives.
            Our days are filled with waves, with ever-changing situations that make us feel that there is no solid
            ground.
            Our jobs, our errands and chores, our relationships, our financial worries—all of these can overwhelm us
            and choke out that spark of divine prayer.
            The multitude of howling forces outside us compel our attention and endanger our peace. </p>
        <p>But Jesus tells us that even in the midst of those experiences, we must fill our hearts with prayer.
            We must cry out to him—not in doubt that he loves us—but with confident faith that he will take care of
            us.
            The grace of prayer to Jesus is meant to be practiced even in our darkest moments, and when done with
            faith, it will bring us interior peace in the midst of the storm. </p>
        <p>We must not be too busy or too stressed for prayer, but instead, we must let prayer permeate our business
            and our worries.
            We can and should have a daily time of scheduled prayer, but we must also be willing to make short,
            quiet prayers to Jesus throughout the day. </p>
        <p>Jesus is within us, and when storms rage around us, we must waken the Master so he can save us by calming
            the wind and the sea.
            Today, turn to Jesus during your busiest moments, and ever so briefly, rejoice in his loving presence.

        <h2 id="week-2-action-items">Week 2 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</li>
            <li>Give up in order to give.</li>
            <li>Be a well set anchor.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</strong>
            In our prayer, fasting, and giving we are seeking to be like Christ.
            We can speak about imitating him, but this is more than copying.
            When we enter our holy hour, we enter into Christ’s own prayer and become interiorly conformed to him,
            joined to his own love for the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            In our sacrifices, we are not just giving things up to be tough.
            We are learning to love like Christ, putting the Father before all else.
            Be both the one who offers the sacrifice for others and the sacrifice itself.</p>
        <p>Everything we give up is ordered toward relationship with God.
            We make sacrifices to spend time with those who are important to us.
            Get up earlier, give up your lunch break, do what it takes to make time for God.
            Stay focused on the goal of union with God in all that we do this Lent. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give up in order to give.</strong>
            Giving alms is a pillar of Lent for a reason.
            Nothing material in this world can completely satisfy a man.
            God gives us good things not to please us but to use for the good of others.
            Lent is a season of increased almsgiving, of greater attention to those in need.
            Make sacrifices for God and he will satisfy you.
            If you sacrifice unnecessary spending, you will be able to give more to others. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Be a well set anchor.</strong>
            The Christian life is made up of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            If you live prayer and asceticism, but not fraternity, you’re doing something, but you’re not living the
            fullness of the Christian life.
            Lean in and build a bond with your brothers.</p>
        <p>A key part of fraternity is being a good anchor.
            Stay honest with your anchor on how you are doing every day.
            Call him on to be honest and regular in his check-ins with you as well.
            Be a dependable, well set anchor.</p>
