        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the
            daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to enter the
            sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and communion with
            the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-pauls-letter-to-the-philippians">A Reading from Paul's Letter to the Philippians</h1>
        <p><em>Have this mind among yourselves, which was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did
                not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,
                being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient
                unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name
                which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and
                under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
                Father.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>It is the third Sunday of Lent, practically the half-way point.
            Make this next week an occasion to redouble your efforts to live out an intense asceticism as you did during
            the first week.
            But before that intensification, today is meant to be an oasis, a day of rest and refreshment, in the midst
            of a hard journey. We have spent a week reflecting on the wonder of praying with and in Christ’s own prayer.
            But today, we take a brief break from reading the Gospel of Mark and turn to St. Paul’s hymn of praise to
            Jesus.
            This hymn is clearly the fruit of St. Paul’s own meditative and contemplative encounters with our Lord, and
            St. Paul invites all “in heaven and on earth and under the earth” to join in his hymn of praise as well as
            the prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>We are to put on the mind of Christ in prayer, praying as the Son of God himself prayed in his human nature.
            He humbled himself to take the form of a slave, submitting to join a limited, time-bound, fragile and
            tiny-nature to his own omnipotence.
            He further humbled himself when he obediently submitted to death, even crucifixion—death in a most
            humiliating and painful manner.
            And why?
            So that his prayer and submission to his Father in the midst of his pain and anguish on the Cross might show
            us how to transform even the moment when we too perish.</p>
        <p>In his great love for us, he not only made himself a sacrificial victim for our sins, he gave us the perfect
            example of a beautiful death that we might imitate him in his prayer and communion with God during our own
            deaths.
            Jesus’ divinity and unfathomable love shines through even the tragedy of the Cross.</p>
        <p>Pray with St. Paul today that you may acquire the mind of Christ.
            That you may pour yourself out in love, and fill that pouring out with prayer as Jesus did.
            Before fasting or almsgiving, before any other great penitential work, pray that Christ will fill your mind
            with prayer.</p>

        <h2 id="week-2-action-items">Week 2 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</li>
            <li>Give up in order to give.</li>
            <li>Be a well set anchor.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</strong>
            In our prayer, fasting, and giving we are seeking to be like Christ.
            We can speak about imitating him, but this is more than copying.
            When we enter our holy hour, we enter into Christ’s own prayer and become interiorly conformed to him,
            joined to his own love for the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            In our sacrifices, we are not just giving things up to be tough.
            We are learning to love like Christ, putting the Father before all else.
            Be both the one who offers the sacrifice for others and the sacrifice itself.</p>
        <p>Everything we give up is ordered toward relationship with God.
            We make sacrifices to spend time with those who are important to us.
            Get up earlier, give up your lunch break, do what it takes to make time for God.
            Stay focused on the goal of union with God in all that we do this Lent. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give up in order to give.</strong>
            Giving alms is a pillar of Lent for a reason.
            Nothing material in this world can completely satisfy a man.
            God gives us good things not to please us but to use for the good of others.
            Lent is a season of increased almsgiving, of greater attention to those in need.
            Make sacrifices for God and he will satisfy you.
            If you sacrifice unnecessary spending, you will be able to give more to others. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Be a well set anchor.</strong>
            The Christian life is made up of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            If you live prayer and asceticism, but not fraternity, you’re doing something, but you’re not living the
            fullness of the Christian life.
            Lean in and build a bond with your brothers.</p>
        <p>A key part of fraternity is being a good anchor.
            Stay honest with your anchor on how you are doing every day.
            Call him on to be honest and regular in his check-ins with you as well.
            Be a dependable, well set anchor.</p>
