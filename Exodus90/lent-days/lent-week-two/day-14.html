        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the
            daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to enter the
            sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and communion with
            the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables. And he
                said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything
                is in parables; so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand;
                lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.” And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable?
                How then will you understand all the parables? The sower sows the word. And these are the ones along the
                path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is
                sown in them. And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the
                word, immediately receive it with joy; and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while;
                then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. And
                others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world, and
                the delight in riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves
                unfruitful. But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and
                bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>If Christ needed the gift of revelation for his human nature, he also needed the gift of grace so that his
            human nature could cooperate fully with his divine nature.
            There is no natural human aptitude to act like God, or to work miracles, but in the Incarnation, Jesus
            needed, in the words of St. Cyril of Alexandria, to accomplish human things divinely.
            This gift of grace whereby the human and divine were in complete conformity is a consequence of the personal
            union of God the Word with his human nature, enabling Jesus to fittingly live out the fullness of his
            Incarnate life. </p>
        <p>That is all very intellectual and heady, but this speculative truth has profound consequences for our
            lives.<br>St. John writes in his Gospel: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.
            . . . And from his fulness have we all received, grace upon grace” (John 1:14,16).
            St. Thomas Aquinas explains this passage by noting, “Grace was received by the soul of Christ in the highest
            way; and therefore from this pre-eminence of grace which he received, it is from him that this grace is
            bestowed on others. . . . Hence the personal grace, whereby the soul of Christ is justified, is essentially
            the same as his grace that justifies others.”
            In short, St. John and St. Thomas both present the vision of Christ as the source of grace for us as if the
            fullness of his anointing from the Holy Spirit flowed down from the head of the Church to fill us, his
            Mystical Body, as well.
            And this reality is the fullness of Christian prayer.</p>
        <p>By participating in the grace of Christ, we participate in Christ himself.
            That is why in his explanation of the parable, Jesus blends the lines between us and him, noting both that
            “the sower sows the word” and that “those [seeds] that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear
            the word and accept it and bear fruit.”
            Those who receive the word are the ones who are sown and participate in the mystery, the grace, and the
            being of our Lord through the experience of transforming prayer from which good fruit springs forth.</p>
        <p>Today meditate on the planting of Christ’s grace within your soul.
            Pray that his grace may take root and bear abundant fruit.
            But this fruit requires good soil, that is, a nourishing life of prayer.
            Ask Christ to teach you to pray as he wants you to pray throughout this week.</p>
