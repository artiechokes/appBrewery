        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in the wilderness.</strong>
            Like the disciples, we are likely reaching the point when our initial burst of enthusiasm is fading, and the
            daily weight of self-denial is wearing us out. But in the midst of the struggle, we are invited to enter the
            sacred silence that is Christ’s own prayer. He wants us to share in his own longing for and communion with
            the Father. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And he said, “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground, and should sleep and
                rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how. The earth produces of itself,
                first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. But when the grain is ripe, at once he
                puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>The second degree of prayer is mediative.
            Using the word degree here should not imply that vocal prayer is left behind; rather in our prayer we may go
            back and forth between the various degrees, as did Jesus himself.
            We see Jesus praying vocally in the synagogue, and then we see him leading us into meditative prayer through
            his parables.
            And we are told that he went into the wilderness, where he was immersed in prayer and the angels ministered
            to him (Mark 1:13,35), which we can assume refers to contemplative prayer.
            We too can move back and forth between these degrees, and sometimes the degrees interpenetrate each other so
            that in our conversing with God we use both vocal and meditative prayer.
            Each psalm of scripture is the fruit of meditation upon the word of God, which can then lead us into vocal
            prayers and inspire further meditation.</p>
        <p>So profound is the experience of prayer, that in a way, we can see prayer as an experience of the kingdom of
            God.
            It brings us before God’s presence and transforms us into citizens of that kingdom.
            God’s word, present on the page, is illuminated by meditation and carried into our heart.
            We are called to meditate on it day and night (Psalms. 1:2), turning it over in our minds, ruminating upon
            it, and allowing it to imprint itself upon our hearts.
            As we repeat the words to ourselves, and reflect upon their meaning, the light of the Holy Spirit enables us
            to understand what God wants to reveal to us. </p>
        <p>In meditation we can start with the smallest seed, a short verse of scripture, and as we turn it over in our
            minds, the meaning becomes clearer.
            What before was an obscure phrase now can take root in our hearts and can stretch into our daily lives so
            that we can see now how God wants us to act in a particular situation. </p>
        <p>Today, therefore, take a short reading from scripture, either today’s selection or some other, and focus on
            just a short verse or phrase.
            Repeat it several times to yourself, and sit quietly reflecting upon its deeper meaning, asking God to help
            you understand what he is saying to you.
            Meditate on it day and night, letting it sink deeply into your heart, and it will grow into you in ways you
            cannot explain.
            In this way, the seed of God will grow and ripen, and we will have a harvest to return to him, the Sower of
            the seed. </p>

        <h2 id="week-2-action-items">Week 2 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</li>
            <li>Give up in order to give.</li>
            <li>Be a well set anchor.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>1. Imitate Christ’s love for the Father.</strong>
            In our prayer, fasting, and giving we are seeking to be like Christ.
            We can speak about imitating him, but this is more than copying.
            When we enter our holy hour, we enter into Christ’s own prayer and become interiorly conformed to him,
            joined to his own love for the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            In our sacrifices, we are not just giving things up to be tough.
            We are learning to love like Christ, putting the Father before all else.
            Be both the one who offers the sacrifice for others and the sacrifice itself.</p>
        <p>Everything we give up is ordered toward relationship with God.
            We make sacrifices to spend time with those who are important to us.
            Get up earlier, give up your lunch break, do what it takes to make time for God.
            Stay focused on the goal of union with God in all that we do this Lent. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give up in order to give.</strong>
            Giving alms is a pillar of Lent for a reason.
            Nothing material in this world can completely satisfy a man.
            God gives us good things not to please us but to use for the good of others.
            Lent is a season of increased almsgiving, of greater attention to those in need.
            Make sacrifices for God and he will satisfy you.
            If you sacrifice unnecessary spending, you will be able to give more to others. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Be a well set anchor.</strong>
            The Christian life is made up of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity.
            If you live prayer and asceticism, but not fraternity, you’re doing something, but you’re not living the
            fullness of the Christian life.
            Lean in and build a bond with your brothers.</p>
        <p>A key part of fraternity is being a good anchor.
            Stay honest with your anchor on how you are doing every day.
            Call him on to be honest and regular in his check-ins with you as well.
            Be a dependable, well set anchor.</p>
