        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee.</strong>
            Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things that are not of Christ. He has great things in store
            for us. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h2 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p><em>And his mother and his brethren came; and standing outside they sent to him and called him. And a crowd
                was sitting about him; and they said to him, “Your mother and your brethren are outside, asking for
                you.” And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brethren?” And looking around on those who sat about
                him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brethren! Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and
                sister, and mother.”</em></p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>We are the mother and brothers of Jesus.
            After all we have seen this week—the mystery of his divinity, the mystery of his humanity, the profound
            unity of his two natures in one divine Person, his redemptive preaching and healing—how can we possibly
            speak of such a one as being our brother, our son?
            Yet it is precisely with this claim that St. Mark ends his question-and-answer search into the mystery of
            who Jesus is.
            What does this mean? </p>
        <p>Our Lord says that whoever does the will of God is his mother and his brother. St. Paul writes, “This is the
            will of God, your sanctification” (I Thessalonians 4:3).
            When we are made holy by God, we are fulfilling his will. And when we are made holy, Christ is again present
            in the world through our action.
            Our hands become his hands, our words, his words.<br>“For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of
            God … you have received the spirit of sonship ... we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs
            of God and fellow heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:14-17).
            We are brothers of Christ because our sanctification makes us into sons of the Father.</p>
        <p>This is the profound message of the Gospel: Christ by taking what is ours, has given to us what is his.
            By taking on our human nature through his birth of a pure, human mother, he has given us his divine nature
            to make men into the sons of God.
            St. Paul adds one caveat, however. We are fellow heirs with Christ “provided we suffer with him in order
            that we may also be glorified with him” (Romans 8:17).
            Christ invites us to fully imitate him in his humanity, which is to invite us to make his suffering our own
            suffering, just as he has made our suffering his own suffering. </p>
        <p>Let us follow Jesus to his Cross, journeying through the rest of this Lent to the Paschal Mystery, and let us
            pray that we may love him more fully as our son and our brother.</p>

            <li>Face temptations in prayer.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television,
                    movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from
                    doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.
                </p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an
                    explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity
                    to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential
                    communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your
                    freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer
                    him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept
                    the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/the-gift-of-asceticism.html">The Gift of
                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It
                    acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to
                    go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also
                    give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live
                    different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our
                    relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person
                    for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
