        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee.</strong>
            Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things that are not of Christ. He has great things in store
            for us. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h2 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p><em>One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to
                pluck
                ears of grain.
                And the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”
                And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and
                those who were with him: how he entered the house of God, when Abi′athar was high priest, and ate
                the
                bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to
                those
                who were with him?”<br>And he said to them, “The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath;
                so
                the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.”
                Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
                And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse
                him.
                And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come here.”
                And he said to them, “Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to
                kill?”
                But they were silent.
                And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man,
                “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
                The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with the Hero′dians against him, how to destroy
                him.</em></p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>“Why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?” </p>
        <p>Throughout this week, Jesus has been revealing himself as the God-Man present in our pain, who transforms
            our
            pain into joy with his presence.
            But we need to be careful and not assume that we cannot feel pain, or sadness, or other “negative”
            emotions
            because as good Christians we should always be happy.
            Why are Jesus and his disciples plucking grain and eating it on the sabbath?
            Because they are hungry.
            They are poor.
            They are exhausted.
            Jesus himself really feels those things.
            Yes, he is God, but he is also man. And as man he finds himself tired and hungry on the day of rest.</p>
        <p>The sabbath was instituted by God as a day when all mankind could rest from their toil and focus on the
            worship of the Lord. God-made-man entered into our fallen condition, and he and his followers were in
            need
            of food on the sabbath day like King David and the soldiers with him who were on a mission and could not
            stop to worship at the ark of the covenant (see 1 Samuel 21:1-7). David was worshipping God by
            fulfilling
            his will, and God, through the sign of the showbread, was present to him in his need and hunger.</p>
        <p>As man, Jesus toils.
            As God, he gives rest. And he does this at one and the same moment.
            His divine rest enters into our anxious toil and becomes a real experience of his divine presence.
            This is not a contradiction.
            God’s presence is life-giving; and whenever we are receiving God’s life, we are entering into his rest.
            It is always lawful for God to feed and heal on the sabbath because the sabbath was made for man to be
            with
            God.
            We can experience both the toil of our God-given duties and God’s rest in that toil because both are
            present
            simultaneously in Jesus.</p>
        <p>In fasting we also find both toil and rest.
            As we fast we may feel hungry, weak, stressed, tired, overwhelmed, and we may come face-to-face with our
            own
            sinfulness.
            This is toil. But God fills our toil with his restorative love.
            Even as we fast, we find healing. We keep praying. We repent. And when we repent, God comes to fill us
            with
            his loving-kindness.
            He is there to remind us that he was hungry too, and that he has transformed the experience of hunger to
            be
            an encounter with divine mercy.</p>
        <p>So in your time of prayer today, present to Christ your withered hand, the brokenness you are discovering
            in
            your penance.
            And ask him to give you his rest as you continue to toil.</p>
        <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for
                you, consider using the <a

            <li>
                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television,
                    movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from
                    doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.
                </p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an
                    explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity
                    to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential
                    communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your
                    freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer
                    him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept
                    the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a

                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It
                    acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to
                    go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also
                    give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live
                    different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our
                    relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person
                    for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
