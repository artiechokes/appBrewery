        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.
        </p>

        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.
        </p>

        <p><b>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee. </b>We have heard the call of Christ, and we have followed
            him, leaving worldly pleasures behind us. Every step of the way moves us further away from the stability of
            our previous life. As we travel through the countryside with Christ, the terrain is difficult, and we may
            miss some of our past pleasures, but there is a mysterious joy amidst the hardships. The source of that joy
            is in the person of Jesus Christ. He has called us to leave behind our normal life and to discover who he
            is. But this is no easy task. There is a mystery about Jesus, but he invites us to continue to ask
            questions. As we seek the answers, we will also come to see that the more we know about who he is, the more
            we will know about who he wants to transform us to be.
        </p>

        <p>Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things that are not Christ’s. He has big things in store for us
            and desires to purify us ever more. Let us be transformed!
        </p>

        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>
        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>
        <h2>A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>

        <p>And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even about the door; and
            [Jesus] was preaching the word to them. And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And
            when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had
            made an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic lay. And when Jesus saw their faith, he
            said to the paralytic, “My son, your sins are forgiven.” Now some of the scribes were sitting there,
            questioning in their hearts, “Why does this man speak thus? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God
            alone?” And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to
            them, “Why do you question thus in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are
            forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your pallet and walk’?</p>

        <p>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—“I
            say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.” </p>

        <p>And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed
            and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>Jesus suddenly presents himself in Galilee with his message of a new kingdom that will deliver us from the
            effects of Adam’s and of our own transgressions. This message is revolutionary, never before heard in all
            its force and grandeur. It is a message more experienced than understood; the crowds were amazed as they saw
            Jesus cast out demons, but not because they comprehended his new teaching. It was the experience of his
            absolute authority not limited by any kind of natural law that led people to know that this was a new kind
            of rabbi.</p>

        <p>Beginning in chapter two, Mark leads us through a series of questions that people ask about Jesus. In asking
            these questions ourselves, and in hearing Jesus’ responses, we are drawn ever more deeply to know who this
            new teacher is. Today, Jesus offers forgiveness of sins, so that we too may question in our hearts, “Who can
            forgive sins but God alone?” Jesus is truly God. The God whom David cried out to for forgiveness in Psalm 51
            is the very one who now walks on earth. Only God can forgive sins, and therefore God incarnate can save us
            from our sins. No mere creature can pardon an offense against the infinite goodness of God. Sin at its core
            is an act of ingratitude and malice, an attack against the very Source of our being. But God is always able
            to draw forth something from nothing. As the catechism teaches: “Since God could create everything out of
            nothing, he can also, through the Holy Spirit, give spiritual life to sinners by creating a pure heart in
            them” (CCC, #298). He reveals his almighty power in the act of forgiving our sins. It is the same almighty
            power that creates everything out of nothing, the same power with which he restores health to lifeless
            limbs, and the same power that creates light out of darkness.</p>

        <p>We do not often think of the immense rupture that our sins create between God and us. Nor do we think of the
            limitless love that induces God to bridge that unbridgeable divide. Today, spend some time contemplating
            that great breach and ponder with gratitude that the good God, whom we have so offended, wants to draw us
            close to him and heal us. God has become the Son of Man. We have never seen anything like this. Let us pray
            that we may be overwhelmed by such beauty and goodness, such magnificent grace.</p>


        <p><i>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,
                consider using the <a

        <h2>Week 1 Action Item</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television, movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.</p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a

                        Prayer</a> from the Field Guide. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you, check out the

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/the-gift-of-asceticism.html">The Gift of
                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
