        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee.</strong>
            Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things that are not of Christ. He has great things in store
            for us. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h2 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>
        <p><em>“Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; but
                whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”— for
                they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.“</em></p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>Who then is Jesus?
            Who is the man who experiences the effects of sin, without sinning, and what is more, who transforms his
            sufferings into redemptive moments? He must be a singular man, a person capable of suffering and redeeming
            in one and the same moment.
            This is the classic theological formulation that the Christian tradition has developed to express the
            mystery of Christ: he is one Person, a single unitary subject, but one who is fully God and fully man. When
            we ask who is acting, the answer is always, God the Word.
            However, the fact that God the Word is the subject does not mean he is not fully human. He acts in
            everything he does, in everything he suffers as both God and man. As God he is redeeming our human
            experience at the very same moment, he is suffering the experience in his human nature.
            There are not two different subjects cooperating together, but rather, one subject acting both divinely and
            humanly.</p>
        <p>St. Maximos the Confessor explains this using the image of a fiery sword: the sword will both cut and burn in
            one and the same motion, having two different principles of action.
            So too with Christ: when he acts or suffers, there will always be both a fully divine action and a fully
            human action.
            To claim that Christ is only human, or only God, or partially both, is to obscure the profound miracle of
            the Holy Spirit and to deny the only path for the redemption of mankind.
            There is no salvation except through the truth of who Jesus Christ is.</p>
        <p>We must, then, bow down and worship Jesus Christ, true God and true man.
            His picture is God’s picture, his touch, truly a divine touch.
            We worship God in a body. His human nature came to us in time, but it will forever continue united to the
            second Person of the Holy Trinity.
            This is an extraordinarily profound mystery, a truth that transcends the limits of our mind. </p>
        <p>The Catechism quotes a prayer that the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom uses to express this mystery: "O
            only-begotten Son and Word of God, immortal being, you who deigned for our salvation to become incarnate of
            the holy Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, you who without change became man and were crucified, O Christ
            our God, you who by your death have crushed death, you who are one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the
            Father and the Holy Spirit, save us!" (CCC, 469).</p>
        <p>Let us worship Jesus, true God and true man, who opens to us the way of our Lenten journey. </p>

            <li>
                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television,
                    movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from
                    doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.
                </p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an
                    explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity
                    to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential
                    communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your
                    freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer
                    him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept
                    the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/the-gift-of-asceticism.html">The Gift of
                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It
                    acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to
                    go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also
                    give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live
                    different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our
                    relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person
                    for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
