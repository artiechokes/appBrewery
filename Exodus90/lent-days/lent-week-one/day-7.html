        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>

        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>

        <p><b>You are traveling with Christ through Galilee. </b>Let’s continue to separate ourselves from the things
            that are not of Christ. He has great things in store for us. Let us be transformed!</p>

        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>
        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>
        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>
        <h2>A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>

        <p><i>He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him, and he taught them. And as he
                passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me.”
                And he rose and followed him. And as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were
                sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him. And the scribes of the
                Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why
                does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are
                well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but
                sinners.”</i></p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>Why does Jesus eat with sinners? Yesterday, Jesus revealed his divinity: he is the omnipotent creator of
            heaven and earth who can forgive sins. Today, we see his divine splendor surrounded by many sinners. He is
            God, but the people feasting with him are the poor, the sinners, the wretched. Why does God not dwell in a
            palace? Why is he not attended by kings, and served by the wealthiest, and the wisest, and the best?</p>

        <p>In answer to the Pharisees, Jesus could have pointed out how even the very best that humanity could offer is
            infinitely beneath the glory of God. He could have laughed at how foolish it is for a Pharisee to think he
            is holy, for a king to think he is mighty, or for a scribe to think he is wise when in the company of
            omnipotence and omniscience. But he did not.</p>

        <p>Instead, Jesus presents to them the fundamental point: why is he here at all? The question should be not who
            is God eating with, but why God is eating on earth? Or walking on earth? What could possibly explain the
            infinite, eternal Being walking the earth in a weak, human body?
            And the answer Jesus gives is: I have come to heal the sick; to forgive sins, to restore what is broken. The
            reason God is on earth as a man is to act as the Divine physician, to call and spiritually heal mankind. Man
            is spiritually broken, alienated from his own being, from his fellow men, from his God. And God has come to
            heal that brokenness.</p>

        <p>Moreover, he has come to heal this fatal wound of man by entering into his nature. St. Athanasius is clear on
            this point: if God wanted to merely forgive sins, he could do so by decree. But God wants to do more. He
            wants to be one of us—to share our humanity and teach us how to share his divinity—healing us from the
            inside out. </p>

        <p>Of course, Jesus cannot make sin itself to be something that is not alienating from God. That is why he shows
            us how to resist temptations when he answers the devil in the desert. That is why he calls Levi away from
            his sinful practices. But once the sinner has responded with contrition and penance, as John the Baptist
            called all to do, then Jesus can heal the devastating effects of sin. He can come to the mess and brokenness
            created by our sins which we cannot fix, no matter how much we may want to, and he can fill that brokenness
            with his healing presence.</p>

        <p>Spend time today reflecting on your own life. Where are the areas left broken by your sins? And then invite
            Jesus into those areas to transform them.</p>

        <p><i>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

        <h2>Week 1 Action Items</h2>

        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Face temptations in prayer.</li>
            <li>Detatch through asceticism.</li>
            <li>Seek Reconciliation with God and others.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Face temptations in prayer. </b>The devil finds ways to encourage us to watch television, movies,
                    or televised sports while at work, alone at home, or while waiting in line to distract us from doing
                    the Lord’s will. Exercise freedom from these mind-numbing temptations. Stay attentive to God in
                    prayer, the place where you can look these temptations in the face and address this with God.</p>

                <p>If you want to see real change in yourself, you need to spend undistracted time talking with and
                    relying on God daily, and that starts today. For more on the importance of prayer and an explanation
                    of silent, contemplative prayer, see <a

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Detach through asceticism. </b>Through this Lenten exercise, God is giving you the opportunity to
                    detach and be present to him and others. Use your mobile devices only for essential communications
                    so that you can be present to those you love. Set your phone out of sight and embrace your freedom.
                </p>
                <p>This detachment cannot remain just a “no.” It needs to become a “yes” of love to God as we offer him
                    these little sacrifices. We can also do so specifically for the intention of others in prayer.
                    Abstaining from meat and fasting offers you opportunities of self-offering all day long. Accept the
                    grace to say “no” to food and “yes” to a sacrifice for others. (For more on asceticism and
                    self-offering see <a
                        href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/the-gift-of-asceticism.html">The Gift of
                        Asceticism</a> in the Field Guide.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seek Reconciliation with God and others. </b>Penance aims at making things right. It acknowledges
                    that we have sinned and need to sacrifice to make up for what we have done, giving up our
                    attachments and getting rightly ordered to God. The best way to achieve the aim of penance is to go
                    to Confession. God will not only give us the grace of forgiveness of our sins, but will also give us
                    the grace that we need to embrace conversion, enter more deeply into penance, and live different.
                </p>
                <p>We also need to reconcile with others, repairing any damage that we have done in our relationships.
                    As we set out on our journey, consider praying together with your family, and ask each person for
                    forgiveness for the ways you may have hurt them.</p>
