        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
            This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and
            which gives us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; and they were
                amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was
                to happen to him, saying, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to
                the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles;
                and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and kill him; and after three days he will
                rise.” …And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are supposed to rule
                over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. But it shall not
                be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first
                among you must be slave of all. For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give
                his life as a ransom for many.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Like action, suffering is both a battleground to learn hope and a opportunity to express it.
            Benedict XVI writes:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>It is not by sidestepping or fleeing from suffering that we are healed, but rather by our capacity for
                accepting it, maturing through it and finding meaning through union with Christ, who suffered with
                infinite love.... Hence in all human suffering we are joined by one who experiences and carries that
                suffering with us. (Spe Salvi, #37,39) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Christ has come to suffer not to spare us from suffering, but to teach us how to suffer united with him so
            that we can continue his redemptive work.
            The level of suffering and the intensity of hope it requires.
            But whether in the smallest inconveniences, or the greatest challenges, we are invited to use sufferings to
            exercise our confident hope that through our suffering, God is able to purify and sanctify us as well as to
            purify others. </p>
        <p>Benedict XVI continues:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>Our capacity to suffer depends on the type and extent of the hope that we bear within us and build upon.
                The saints were able to make the great journey of human existence in the way that Christ had done before
                them, because they were brimming with great hope. (Spe Salvi, #39)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We can start by making acts of hope in our small sufferings so that we may grow to be capable of hope in our
            great sufferings.
            We should also be inspired by the witness of those who have gone before us.
            The transformative power of Christ’s grace is made manifest in the saints.
            Heroic faith and hope shine in the faces of the saints and martyrs who have given their lives for the love
            of Christ and his brothers.</p>
        <p>Today, resolve to make every inconvenience and suffering, small or big, an occasion to exercise hope in
            Christ.
            Offer that suffering to him, united to his suffering, with confident hope that your suffering will extend
            his redemption into the world around you.</p>

        <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make a good confession.</li>
            <li>Give alms.</li>
            <li>Use the computer as a tool. </li>
            <li>Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
        <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>
