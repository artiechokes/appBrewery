        <h1 class="section-header">Hope and Prayer</h1>
  <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
<p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
<p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and which gives us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross. 
Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end. 
Let us be transformed!</p>
<p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season of Lent.</p>
<p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.</em></p>
<h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
<p><em>And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd about them, and scribes arguing with them. And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and ran up to him and greeted him. And he asked them, “What are you discussing with them?” And one of the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a dumb spirit; and wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.” And he answered them, “O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.” And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked his father, “How long has he had this?” And he said, “From childhood. And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.” And Jesus said to him, “If you can! All things are possible to him who believes.” Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!” And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.” And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, “He is dead.” But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting.”</em></p>
<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>Prayer and fasting; communion and suffering: this is the battleground of hope. 
We pray in hope, and we suffer, voluntarily and involuntarily, in hope. 
And it is only through prayer and suffering that we can help to heal the sufferings of others. 
Certain afflictions can only be driven out by prayer and fasting because these are what purify and make us better able to be channels of Christ’s saving grace. </p>
<p>Benedict XVI writes: </p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p>When we pray properly, we undergo a process of inner purification which opens us up to God and thus to our fellow human beings as well. In prayer we must learn what we can truly ask of God—what is worthy of God. We must learn that we cannot pray against others. We must learn that we cannot ask for the superficial and comfortable things that we desire at this moment—that meagre, misplaced hope that leads us away from God. We must learn to purify our desires and our hopes. We must free ourselves from the hidden lies with which we deceive ourselves.... My encounter with God awakens my conscience in such a way that it no longer aims at self-justification, and is no longer a mere reflection of me and those of my contemporaries who shape my thinking, but it becomes a capacity for listening to the Good itself.... In this way we undergo those purifications by which we become open to God and are prepared for the service of our fellow human beings. We become capable of the great hope, and thus we become ministers of hope for others. (Spe Salvi, #33,34)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prayer as an act of hope demands that our prayer be deeply personal, raw, vulnerable and honest. 
But as with faith, our interior life is always measured by God who transcends us, and therefore we need our prayer also to be measured by and offered in union with the prayers of the Church: the psalms, the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the prayers of the liturgy.
Just as there is a dialogue between the teachings of faith and our inner life of faith, so too is there a dialogue between public and private prayer.</p>
<p>This purifying prayer and fasting enlarges our hearts, increases our confidence in God, and makes us more aware of our dependence on his help. 
It also increases our hope. 
If we are too confident in our own power, or if we doubt that God wishes to liberate the captive, or doubt that he wishes to work through us, our hope is imperfect. </p>
<p>Pray today with hope. 
Confess your weaknesses to God and ask him to come and heal them and use you as a vessel of mercy to the world.</p>

        <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make a good confession.</li>
            <li>Give alms.</li>
            <li>Use the computer as a tool. </li>
            <li>Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
        <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>
