        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in Jerusalem.</strong>
            At last, we have arrived in Jerusalem.
            This is the final week of preparation for our encounter with the Risen Christ.
            We have focused on preparing though prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. We have spent the last two weeks
            meditating on how we are interiorly transformed to be Christ in faith and in hope.
            Now this week, we will focus on the greatest transformation: our transformation to love with Christ’s love.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Beth′phage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of
                his disciples, and said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you
                will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it. If any one says to you, ‘Why
                are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’” And they
                went away, and found a colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it. And those who
                stood there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” And they told them what Jesus had
                said; and they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he
                sat upon it. And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had
                cut from the fields. And those who went before and those who followed cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he
                who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna in
                the highest!” And he entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had looked round at
                everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Palm Sunday is an intermediate day, partly anticipating the joy of Easter, partly anticipating the deep
            sorrows of the Cross.
            If the Transfiguration of Christ manifests to us the virtue of hope, Palm Sunday is a manifestation to us of
            divine charity, partially hidden, and partially revealed. </p>
        <p>St. Paul writes that there are three virtues that endure into heaven because they pertain to God.
            These virtues are more divine than human, transforming us even now to enable us to participate in the
            divine-human life of Jesus Christ.
            Those three virtues are faith, hope, and love.
            St. Paul adds that the greatest of these is love.
            Love is the crown of the virtues, the most God-like activity that we can do.
            God alone perfectly loves himself, with the Father infinitely breathing forth the Spirit of Love upon his
            Son.
            All creatures are made God-like to the extent that they love as God loves.
            No creature can love the infinitely lovable God as much as he can and should be loved; they can only love
            God as much they are able, striving always to contemplate God with love.
            Perpetual, conscious contemplation of God belongs to eternal life.
            Only those purified beings in heaven are capable of that perfection of love.</p>
        <p>But in this life, we must love consciously and unconsciously.
            A husband cannot think of his wife every second, but he must still be faithful to his vows at every moment
            of the day, even when he is not consciously thinking of his wife.
            So too for Christians in this life, we will need to sleep, focus on difficult tasks, and the rest, but at
            all times we must live such that nothing we do or think is more important to us than God.
            Further, everything we do needs to be ultimately—if not always consciously—ordered to God.
            Just as a married man must order all of his work toward loving and caring for his wife, so too must we order
            all we do to our loving relationship with God. </p>
        <p>We are in an intermediate stage: at times our love for God is manifest and conscious, and at times it is
            hidden and unconscious.
            The grace God has poured into our hearts is hidden, but the more conscious acts of love we make, the more we
            strive to live in God’s presence, the more we will experience his grace flowing into our hearts.
            Although the perfection of the saints in heaven is not yet possible to us, we must nevertheless endeavor to
            emulate it.
            During this last week of Lent, it is especially good to be as consciously attentive to God and to make as
            many acts of love of him as possible.
            Every act of love will make our love for God increase.</p>
        <p>On this Palm Sunday, make conscious acts of love toward God, rejoicing in his love and goodness, and praying
            to be transformed by his Paschal love.</p>

        <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make a good confession.</li>
            <li>Give alms.</li>
            <li>Use the computer as a tool. </li>
            <li>Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
        <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>
