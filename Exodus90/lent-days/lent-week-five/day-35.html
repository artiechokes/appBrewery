        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
            This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and
            which gives us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before
                they see the kingdom of God come with power.” And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and
                John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them, and his
                garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on earth could bleach them. And there appeared
                to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus. And Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is well
                that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” For he
                did not know what to say, for they were exceedingly afraid. And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice
                came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son; listen to him.” And suddenly looking around they no
                longer saw any one with them but Jesus only.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Benedict XVI writes:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>“[Our] great hope can only be God, who encompasses the whole of reality and who can bestow upon us what
                we, by ourselves, cannot attain.
                The fact that it comes to us as a gift is actually part of hope. God is the foundation of hope... the
                God who has a human face and who has loved us to the end.... His Kingdom is present wherever he is loved
                and wherever his love reaches us. His love alone gives us the possibility of soberly persevering day by
                day, without ceasing to be spurred on by hope, in a world which by its very nature is imperfect. His
                love is at the same time our guarantee of the existence of what we only vaguely sense and which
                nevertheless, in our deepest self, we await: a life that is ‘truly’ life. (Spe Salvi, #31)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We can make Christ’s confidence our own, precisely because we can rely on God’s love and power to give us
            divine goods.
            Hope, therefore, is two-fold: it lets us see the rewards and graces given to Christ as things that are also
            meant for us.
            Those divine gifts—the gift of knowing God, of being made his son, of acting with the strength of his mighty
            power—those gifts belong to us, even here on earth, inasmuch as we partake in Christ.
            And that is the second part of hope: we have confidence in claiming these divine gifts because we have them
            as gifts.
            If we did not realize this glory is ours in virtue of divine graciousness, then we would either not really
            understand how awesome these gifts are, or how lowly we are.
            But in either case, we would not be sharing in Christ’s confidence, because Christ both comprehends the
            abyss between God and man and utter confidence in his Father’s infinite love to overcome that abyss. </p>
        <p>When we share in Christ’s own confidence, the divine goods of the Kingdom of God will be accessible in our
            present lives.
            Christ did not walk the earth in transfigured glory, but hid that reality within him, a reality present by
            his confident union with his Father in his human will, even as he prepared to be crucified.
            Christ’s transfiguration is a physical manifestation of the reality of our hope.
            Such hope is awe-inspiring because it opens up expectations that we had never before considered. </p>
        <p>If we share in Christ’s confidence and grace, we will also share in the labors asked of him as he pursued
            eternal life.
            We may, like Peter, desire to bask in the confidence of hope, without enduring the struggles.
            But God is gentle, and he reminds us that he will be with us, like a pillar of cloud, to shade us in the
            burning heat of our struggles.
            Pray in hope today, asking God in his infinite mercy to sustain you through the remaining labors of Lent,
            and to fill you with grace of the forgiveness of sins and the hope of resurrected life.</p>

        <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make a good confession.</li>
            <li>Give alms.</li>
            <li>Use the computer as a tool. </li>
            <li>Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
        <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>
