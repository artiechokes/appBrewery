        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are journeying to Jerusalem.</strong>
            This is the final leg of the journey.
            Beginning this week, we are leaving Galilee and making straight for Jerusalem.
            We are looking at the heart of discipleship: transformation in Christ.
            We disciples take on the very life of our master by the gift of the Holy Spirit.
            Christ lives his life anew in us.
            This is why we are considering the three aspects of the inner life of Christ as it is lived by us.
            Last week we focused on faith: the invitation to become sons by putting on the mind of Christ and seeing him
            and the world through his eyes.
            This week we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and which gives us the
            strength to journey with him, even to the sufferings of the Cross.
            Let’s tighten our belts, set our wills, and keep our eyes fixed on our beloved Lord who has pioneered the
            way for us.
            Easter and new life are coming.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his
                disciples, “Who do men say that I am?” And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and
                others one of the prophets.” And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You
                are the Christ.” And he charged them to tell no one about him. And he began to teach them that the Son
                of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and
                be killed, and after three days rise again. And he said this plainly. And Peter took him, and began to
                rebuke him. But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For
                you are not on the side of God, but of men.” And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and
                said to them, “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
                For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s
                will save it. For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? For what can
                a man give in return for his life? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and
                sinful generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father
                with the holy angels.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>We are not only called to share Christ’s vision of God and the world—we are called to make things happen.
            As Benedict XVI notes:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>The Gospel is not merely a communication of things that can be known—it is one that makes things happen
                and is life-changing. The dark door of time, of the future, has been thrown open. The one who has hope
                lives differently; the one who hopes has been granted the gift of a new life. (Spe Salvi, #2)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The gift of faith is an encounter with the living God, and that encounter is life-changing.
            Pope Benedict continues: </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>Jesus, who himself died on the Cross, brought something totally different: an encounter with the Lord of
                all lords, an encounter with the living God and thus an encounter with a hope stronger than the
                sufferings of slavery, a hope which therefore transformed life and the world from within. (Spe Salvi,
                #4)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This encounter of faith needs to penetrate even into an encounter with Christ crucified.
            Peter, in today’s reading, sees Jesus as the Messiah, the promised, chosen Christ of God.
            But Peter will have to encounter Christ betrayed, killed, and risen, to encounter the Lord who by his own
            suffering and death, overcomes death.
            As Benedict XVI concludes:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>The true shepherd is one who knows even the path that passes through the valley of death; One who walks
                with me even on the path of final solitude, where no one can accompany me, guiding me through: he
                himself has walked this path, he has descended into the kingdom of death, he has conquered death, and he
                has returned to accompany us now and to give us the certainty that, together with him, we can find a way
                through. The realization that there is One who even in death accompanies me, and with his ‘rod and his
                staff comforts me,’ so that ‘I fear no evil,’ this was the new ‘hope’ that arose over the life of
                believers. (Spe Salvi, #6)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Faith alone is not enough, although it is essential.
            Faith gives us an encounter with the living Christ and we begin to understand what our life is meant to be.
            But hope builds on this encounter.
            Not only are we invited to participate in Christ’s vision of the world, we are invited to have confident
            hope in his having overcome the wages of sin, which is death.
            Hope lets us make Christ’s conquering our own: with the help of his grace, we will safely pass through even
            the sufferings and terrors of our own deaths.
            The eternally satisfying goods that belong to Jesus will be shared with us, and so, making his good our own,
            we make his hope our own as well.</p>
        <p>Today, pray in hope.
            In confidence ask Christ to give you the kingdom of God, even now, within your own heart.
            Ask him to let the eternal life that he has promised begin now in this earthly life. </p>

        <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,
                consider using the <a
                    href="https://exodus.artiechokes.com/field-guide/how-to-pray-a-holy-hour.html">Holy
                    Hour Guide.</a></em></p>
        <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
        <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>
