        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
            This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and
            which gives us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And they came to Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude,
                Bartimae′us, a blind beggar, the son of Timae′us, was sitting by the roadside. And when he heard that it
                was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” And many
                rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
                And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; rise,
                he is calling you.” And throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus. And Jesus said to him,
                “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Master, let me receive my sight.”
                And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he received his
                sight and followed him on the way.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>The last sign that Jesus works in St. John’s Gospel is the raising of Lazarus.
            In St. Mark’s Gospel, the last miracle that Jesus works before his triumphant entrance into Jerusalem is the
            curing of the blind man—a man who is the son of a Gentile (Timaeus) but who is named as a Hebrew,
            Bartimaeus.
            This last miracle unites the entire message of the Gospel up to this point: Christ has come to extend his
            redemption beyond Israel to all men.
            He comes to undo the curse of Adam and to transform us into the sons of God.
            He wants us to call out in prayer to him in the midst of our suffering and ask for his mercy.
            We call out when we pray, when we fast, and when we extend mercy to others.
            And in these activities, Christ comes to us, enters our experience, and transforms it, giving us a share in
            his divine life and redemptive work. </p>
        <p>He gives us faith so that we can know God as he does.
            And having faith, we can follow him in hope, confident that he will supply for all we lack, enabling us to
            go where he is going and do what he is doing.
            Often We often hear Christians say that such and such a charitable act is the work of a Mother Teresa, or
            that intense prayer is what monks do.
            The implication is that what Christ did and the way he did it is only obtainable by a select few.
            Instead, St. Mark’s Gospel tells us: ask God to transform you into Christ.
            Deepen your experience of faith: hear God’s word!
            Strive to see his face!
            Do everything you can to make this gift a reality, even though nothing you can do will ever earn such a
            gift.
            Pray!
            Fast!
            Give alms!
            And have confidence that he will transform you.
            Get up and follow him, even to his Cross.</p>
        <p>But as you follow him in faith and hope, it will become clear that there is yet a further and more perfect
            way that Christ wishes to transform you.
            We will consider the virtue of charity next week.</p>

        <p><i>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

        <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make a good confession.</li>
            <li>Give alms.</li>
            <li>Use the computer as a tool. </li>
            <li>Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
        <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>
