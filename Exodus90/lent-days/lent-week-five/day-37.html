        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are journeying toward Jerusalem.</strong>
            This last week before Holy Week, we will focus on hope: the hope of Christ that dwells in our hearts and
            which gives us the strength to journey with him through the sufferings of the Cross.
            Time to persevere unflaggingly to the end.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it; for he was
                teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and
                they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.” But they did not understand
                the saying, and they were afraid to as him…. And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and
                knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said
                to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not kill,
                Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and
                mother.’” And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.” And Jesus looking upon
                him loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and
                you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” At that saying his countenance fell, and he went
                away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>The daily grind of Christian living can be exhausting.
            Keeping the commandments, falling, repenting, returning to live out God’s law—that alone is challenging.
            To add to that our work to help others, to practice almsgiving and works of mercy, to pour ourselves out for
            the good of those we love, and to see no results for such effort, this too is exhausting.
            As Benedict XVI notes:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>Only the great certitude of hope that my own life and history in general, despite all failures, are held
                firm by the indestructible power of Love, and that this gives them their meaning and importance, only
                this kind of hope can then give the courage to act and to persevere. (Spe Salvi, #35) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Our efforts to at love others and serve as a vessel of mercy will not transform this world into the Kingdom
            of God; the Kingdom remains a gratuitous gift wherever it arises in the hearts of men.<br>And our efforts
            alone will not earn eternal life.
            Heaven is always a gift.
            Benedict XVI continues:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>Even when we are fully aware that Heaven far exceeds what we can merit, it will always be true that our
                behavior is not indifferent before God and therefore is not indifferent for the unfolding of history. We
                can open ourselves and the world and allow God to enter: we can open ourselves to truth, to love, to
                what is good. This is what the saints did, those who, as ‘God's fellow workers,’ contributed to the
                world's salvation. (Spe Salvi, #35) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Our actions, therefore, can communicate hope to those in need; our almsgiving can be the occasion of
            rejuvenating someone who is suffering.
            Ultimately, our actions are rooted in and the fruits of the great hope we have in Christ Jesus.
            If we believed that on our own power we could please God as Jesus did, we would soon fail, and, like the
            rich man, go away sad.
            But if we confidently rely on the power of Christ, then we will be sustained even as we sacrificially give
            of ourselves to those in need.</p>
        <p>Resolve to make a concrete act of mercy today, both to communicate hope to someone, and to express the
            confidence of hope in the power of his love that is growing within your heart.</p>

        <h2 id="week-5-action-items">Week 5 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make a good confession.</li>
            <li>Give alms.</li>
            <li>Use the computer as a tool. </li>
            <li>Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Make a good confession.</strong>
            If you haven’t gone to confession in the past four weeks, this is the week.
            Find a local church, check their confession time, and go.
            If you can’t make that time, call the priest and make an individual appointment.
            It’s that important!
            The Lord will work with his transforming grace in your life through this sacraments.
            He gives us not only his forgiveness but also healing and strength to avoid sin.
            Confession is a great gift and a perfect way to finish our Lenten journey of transformation strongly. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Give alms.</strong>
            This time of abstaining from purchasing material things is a time to reset your view on money and goods.
            Allow the Lord to free you from the need to spend his money on yourself.
            In turn, allow the Lord to give you the grace to give his money away to others.
            (For married men, always communicate with your wife before making financial decisions.)</p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the computer as a tool.</strong>
            When a tool is needed, use it well.
            When it’s not needed, don’t use it.
            The Lord is calling you to action; stay alert, not distracted.
            Breaking our attachment to devices is part of the transforming freedom he wants to give us this Lent.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make an Easter plan with your fraternity.</strong>
            This Lent, you and your fraternity have taken up the fullness of the Christian life—prayer, asceticism, and
            fraternity—in order to change your lives.
            On Easter Sunday you’ll have a choice: go back to the way you used to live or keep living the fullness of
            the Christian life with your brothers.
            Here’s the most consistent biggest piece of advice Exodus Men continuously give to new fraternities: “Make a
            plan to keep meeting as a fraternity after Easter.”
            Exodus provides an Easter exercise that will focus on forming a sustainable and customizable rule of life
            and integrating celebration into our practice of the Christian life. </p>
        <p>What will you do?
            Message your brothers and start making a plan with your fraternity.</p>
