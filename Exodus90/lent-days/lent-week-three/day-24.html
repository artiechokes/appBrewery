        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer
            for transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble
            ourselves and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during
            this season of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler’s house some who said, “Your daughter
                is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?” But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to
                the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.” And he allowed no one to follow him
                except Peter and James and John the brother of James. When they came to the house of the
                ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly. And when he
                had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but
                sleeping.” And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside, and took the child’s father
                and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. Taking her by the
                hand he said to her, “Talitha cumi”; which means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise.” And
                immediately the girl got up and walked; for she was twelve years old. And immediately they
                were overcome with amazement. And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and
                told them to give her something to eat.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>The crowds laughed at Jesus because they did not believe in his generosity.
            We may imagine that our generosity will be respected, appreciated, and praised.
            But that is not always the case.
            Almsgiving can spark jealousy, accusations, suspicions, and fears, either among those who
            witness our giving, or even among those who benefit from it.
            Our fallen human nature with its mean, ungrateful, and base inclinations can turn against a
            benefactor even in moments when we should be grateful.</p>
        <p>So, we must be ready to suffer when we give alms.
            Sometimes the suffering will come from the pain of parting with some of our goods.
            St. Basil noted long ago that the moment we have a possession, we form an intense attachment to
            it almost as if it were a part of us.
            The first pain of almsgiving, therefore, may well be just the parting with the possession.
            At other times, the almsgiving itself may be an occasion of ridicule as we share the Gospel, or
            are seen associating with a disreputable person.
            Our Lord’s acts of kindness to Samaritans and sinners were often occasions for criticism. </p>
        <p>Our almsgiving may also be the gift of ourselves, our willingness to lay down our life or to
            suffer in our flesh for the sake of saving our neighbor.
            We must be ready and willing to lay down our life if it will save someone from eternal
            damnation.
            And there are many other ways whereby we may sacrifice ourselves in works of mercy.<br>The
            Second Vatican Council teaches: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“The Lord Jesus implied a certain likeness between the union of the divine Persons, and the
                unity of God's sons in truth and charity. This likeness reveals that man, who is the only
                creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a
                sincere gift of himself.” (Gaudium et Spes, #24) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the end, all of our almsgiving is to be a sincere gift of self.
            That is what gives it its value.
            If we give sacrificially, it reflects the proper meaning of the gift and helps further our union
            with our Lord. </p>
        <p>Today, ask our Lord to show you how to give alms as an expression of your sincere gift of self.

        <h2 id="week-3-action-items">Week 3 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make good use of time.</li>
            <li>Discipline and train your body and soul. </li>
            <li>Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
        <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
        <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
        <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>
