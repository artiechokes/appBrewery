        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            As we continue to journey with Christ through the Gospel of Mark, we find ourselves across the sea in the
            land of the Gentiles.
            It is a godless land, filled with demonic whispering, the fear of death, slavery, animal-like savagery, and
            unclean desires.
            It is the darkest part of our own heart, buried in sin and alienated from God.
            It is the land of our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride.
            As we have fasted and prayed we have acknowledged our own sins and weaknesses.
            Jesus knows our weaknesses and greatly desires to save us from them.
            He tells us that when we are confronted with our selfish pride, we must humble ourselves and pray for his
            help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving. Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Ger′asenes.
                And when Jesus had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
                who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, even with a chain; for he had often been
                bound with fetters and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the fetters he broke in pieces; and
                no one had the strength to subdue him.
                Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and bruising himself with
                stones.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Last week we considered how Jesus knows the truth in two ways: he knows reality with his divine intellect,
            and he knows it with his human intellect.
            Similarly, Jesus has two wills: a divine will and a human will.
            This means, therefore, that Jesus loves us divinely and humanly.
            All humans also love in a two-fold way.
            We love by an act of the will so that we desire goodness for another in the way that we desire goodness for
            ourselves.
            For example, when a father loves his son, he wants what is best for his son, so much so that he is willing
            to sacrifice himself for his son’s good precisely because his love has made his son’s good his own good.
            This love of the will is done in light of the immortality of our souls; it transcends the limits of our
            merely bodily desires.</p>
        <p>But there is another way we love.
            Love in this sense is in our emotions and is tied to our bodies: we get butterflies in the stomach, we
            flush, our heart beats faster.
            This emotional love is love too, and often there is a back and forth between the love of our wills and the
            love of our emotions: sometimes emotional love moves our wills to love, and sometimes our wills stir up our
            emotions. </p>
        <p>When Jesus loves, he loves in a three-fold way.
            Pope Pius XII explains this: </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>The physical heart of Jesus Christ, united to the divine Person of the Word, beat with love and with the
                other emotions but these, joined to a human will full of divine charity and to the infinite love itself
                which the Son shares with the Father and the Holy Spirit, were in such complete unity and agreement that
                never among these three loves was there any contradiction or disharmony. . . . The Heart of the
                Incarnate Word is the chief sign and symbol of that threefold love with which the divine Redeemer
                unceasingly loves his Father and all mankind. (Haurietis Aquas, #41, 54)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When Jesus loves us, he loves us as he has from all eternity as God. He also loves us with his grace-filled
            human will, and he loves us physically with his emotions.
            As St. Maximus of Turin writes, “in Christ our own flesh loves us.”<br>When Jesus comes to heal our pain,
            therefore, he does not come dispassionately.
            He arrives at the tombs and sees the man with an unclean spirit, crying out and bruising himself.
            And he feels deep compassion for him and for us, bound by our sins and suffering.
            His divine love expresses itself in human will and in a physical heartbeat. </p>
        <p>As we think about almsgiving this week, let us remember the deeply personal love that should motivate such
            gifts.
            Spend today meditating on Jesus’ threefold love, and rejoice that you are loved so well.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2 id="week-3-action-items">Week 3 Action Items</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
        <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
        <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
        <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>
