        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble ourselves
            and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and prostrated before him; and crying out with a loud voice, he
                said, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment
                me.” For he had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!” And Jesus asked him, “What is
                your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion; for we are many.” And he begged him eagerly not to send them
                out of the country. Now a great herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him,
                “Send us to the swine, let us enter them.” So he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and
                entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea,
                and were drowned in the sea.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>The Catechism states:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>In its various forms—material deprivation, unjust oppression, physical and psychological illness and
                death—human misery is the obvious sign of the inherited condition of frailty and need for salvation in
                which man finds himself as a consequence of original sin. This misery elicited the compassion of Christ
                the Savior, who willingly took it upon himself and identified himself with the least of his brethren.
                Hence, those who are oppressed by poverty are the object of a preferential love on the part of the
                Church which, since her origin and in spite of the failings of many of her members, has not ceased to
                work for their relief, defense, and liberation through numerous works of charity which remain
                indispensable always and everywhere. (CCC, #2448)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Jesus’ threefold love is not merely sentimental; it is redemptive.
            It liberates us, defends us, and gives us relief from our suffering.
            Jesus’ divine love makes him present in our temporal pain, and then his human love, joined to that divine
            love, transforms our pain into an occasion of communion with him.
            We are called to love others as Jesus loves us in our actions such as almsgiving or other works of mercy.
            As the Catechism notes:</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual
                and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as
                are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding
                the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying
                the dead. Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity:
                it is also a work of justice pleasing to God. (CCC, #2447)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Our prayerful union with Christ expresses itself in our imitation of him.
            To put on the mind of Christ is to be willing to pour oneself out as Christ did as a merciful gift to those
            in need. </p>
        <p>Today, reflect on the ways that Jesus has come to you in your pain and relieved you.
            And then consider how you can concretely extend that mercy to others in need around you. </p>
        <p><em>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,

        <h2 id="week-3-action-items">Week 3 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make good use of time.</li>
            <li>Discipline and train your body and soul. </li>
            <li>Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
        <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
        <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
        <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>
