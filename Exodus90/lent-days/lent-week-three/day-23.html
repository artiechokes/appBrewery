        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble ourselves
            and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him; and he
                was beside the sea. Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he
                fell at his feet, and besought him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay
                your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.” And he went with him. And a great crowd
                followed him and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,
                and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but
                rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and
                touched his garment. For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well.” And immediately
                the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus,
                perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, immediately turned about in the crowd, and
                said, “Who touched my garments?” And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you,
                and yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’” And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing
                what had been done to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him the whole
                truth. And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your
                disease.”</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>We receive so much mail from organizations asking for our help and see the same kinds of requests on our
            screens, and we rightly ask, “How do I know whom to help?’
            And Jesus’ answer today is, “Help those right in front of you.”
            We must begin giving alms to the people we encounter in our daily lives.
            Jesus’ teaching was interrupted by the begging Jairus; his garment was secretly touched by the hemorrhaging
            woman; and he immediately responded to both. </p>
        <p>Often we develop habits of ignoring those in need, so the first thing we need to do is to develop an
            awareness of the needy.
            While there may be a good reason not to give money directly to a panhandler, there is never a reason to
            completely ignore the human dignity of someone in need.
            A humane encounter, a look in the eyes, or a smile for a poor homeless beggar might be the best gift of
            their day.
            As Mother Teresa notes, “Many people talk about the homeless, but few talk to them.”</p>
        <p>Of course, prudence is always required.
            One should not go into dark alleys looking for someone in need.
            But we can all do more than we are currently doing.
            As we develop habits of compassionate attention, people will feel comfortable asking us for aid.
            While now we may think there is no one who needs my assistance, practicing Christ-like habits of noticing
            others will likely reveal how many truly are in need.</p>
        <p>We can also be prepared to be better givers: with gift certificates to restaurants, distributable snacks, or
            even dollar bills will make us responsive to those in need.
            The money we save by avoiding big purchases or observing a stricter fast should be used to make us more
            available as givers.
            As you walk down the street, put down your phone and strive to notice who may need your help. </p>

        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make good use of time.</li>
            <li>Discipline and train your body and soul. </li>
            <li>Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
        <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
        <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
        <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>
