        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer
            for transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble
            ourselves and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during
            this season of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them
                authority over the unclean spirits. He charged them to take nothing for their journey except
                a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; but to wear sandals and not put on two
                tunics. And he said to them, “Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.
                And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off
                the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.” So they went out and preached
                that men should repent. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were
                sick and healed them.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Our Lord gave himself to all mankind.
            We are more limited in our capacity for self-giving, and what is more, a general desire to do
            something good for humanity may lead us to neglect the people right in front of us.
            That’s what is so marvelous about the way that Jesus gives himself to us.
            As Pope Pius XII notes: </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>The knowledge and love of our Divine Redeemer, of which we were the object from the first
                moment of His Incarnation, exceed all the human intellect can hope to grasp. For hardly was
                He conceived in the womb of the Mother of God, when [through his own vision of God] all the
                members of His Mystical Body were continually and unceasingly present to Him, and He
                embraced them with His redeeming love. O marvelous condescension of divine love for us! O
                inestimable dispensation of boundless charity! In the crib, on the Cross, in the unending
                glory of the Father, Christ has all the members of the Church present before Him and united
                to Him in a much clearer and more loving manner than that of a mother who clasps her child
                to her breast, or than that with which a man knows and loves himself. (Mystici Corporis,
                #75) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Jesus, in his human nature, was given the grace to know God as God exists in himself.
            Of course, this vision did not extend to the entirety of the infinite divine essence (no created
            intellect can do that), but Jesus, in his human intellect did have a direct perception of God,
            and, through that perception, a miraculous perception of each of us.
            Jesus loves all mankind, but he loves all by loving each particularly, not as some abstraction
            or generality that does not take into account our individuality. </p>
        <p>As we discern how to imitate the expansiveness of Jesus’ almsgiving, we must keep in mind the
            particular way that Jesus gives.
            The more we are attentive to a particular human’s needs, to the individuality of the person
            involved, the more we are giving the way Christ gives. Certainly, the more people we can help
            the better, but it is not the larger numbers that matters as much as our love that is attentive
            to the particular individual and his needs. </p>
        <p>Today, think of at least one person that you can give alms to in this manner, imitating the way
            Jesus loves.
            Then ask yourself whether you can extend that kind of love to at least two more people as well.
            Push yourself as far as you can to give as personally as possible to as many as possible.</p>

        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make good use of time.</li>
            <li>Discipline and train your body and soul. </li>
            <li>Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
        <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
        <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
        <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>
