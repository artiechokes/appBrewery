        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer
            for transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble
            ourselves and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during
            this season of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. And he said
                to them, “Come away by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while.” For many were coming
                and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a lonely
                place by themselves. Now many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from
                all the towns, and got there ahead of them. As he landed he saw a great throng, and he had
                compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach
                them many things. And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a
                lonely place, and the hour is now late; send them away, to go into the country and villages
                round about and buy themselves something to eat.” But he answered them, “You give them
                something to eat.” And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of
                bread, and give it to them to eat?” And he said to them, “How many loaves have you? Go and
                see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” Then he commanded them
                all to sit down by companies upon the green grass. So they sat down in groups, by hundreds
                and by fifties. And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and
                blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people; and
                he divided the two fish among them all. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took
                up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. And those who ate the loaves were
                five thousand men.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Oftentimes we think of almsgiving as something done from our abundance, from what we have in
            excess, and there is something very true about that.
            St. John Chrysostom notes that when we have more than we need, “Not to enable the poor to share
            in our goods is to steal from them and deprive them of life. The goods we possess are not ours,
            but theirs.”
            If I am throwing away food because I have too much while my neighbor is starving, it is not
            generosity that demands I give him food, but justice.</p>
        <p>Mother Teresa tells the story of a starving woman to whom she gave a bag of rice.
            This woman immediately poured out half the rice and gave it to her neighbor who was also
            starving.
            This is superlative almsgiving: giving from your need to others who have no claim to your gift.
            This is the almsgiving of our Lord.</p>
        <p>Jesus and his disciples do not have enough food for themselves; five loaves and two fish are
            barely enough to feed thirteen men for a day.
            Yet Jesus commands them to give from their lack, from their poverty, and he multiplies that gift
            to more than satisfy the hunger of five thousand men.
            If we want Christ to use us, we must empty ourselves of our pride.
            We must never give alms because we are so good or important.
            If we put on the mind of Christ, his personal love for others, he fills us and pours out himself
            through us.</p>
        <p>This is the most amazing part of almsgiving: in the end we are not giving from our own abundance
            of love for Jesus, or out of our own holiness.
            We are not giving of ourselves because we ourselves are such a precious gift.
            We give of ourselves so that there is nothing to interfere with Jesus giving himself to others
            through us. </p>
        <p>Today, let us humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord.
            Let us put on the mind of Christ, empty ourselves of our pride, and ask him to make us channels
            of his grace to those in need.</p>

        <h2 id="week-3-action-items">Week 3 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make good use of time.</li>
            <li>Discipline and train your body and soul. </li>
            <li>Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
        <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
        <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
        <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>
