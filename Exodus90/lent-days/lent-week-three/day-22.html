        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings.
            Where are you today?
            In this Lenten exercise, in the scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self?
            Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for the day.</p>
        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>
        <p><strong>You are in a foreign land.</strong>
            When we are confronted with our selfishness, our self-idolization, and our pride, we must humble ourselves
            and pray for the Lord’s help in resisting our evil inclinations.
            Let us learn the true meaning of almsgiving.
            Let us be transformed!</p>
        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>
        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you. </p>
        <p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>
        <p><em>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                Thy kingdom come.
                Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us this day our daily bread.
                And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
                And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
                Amen.</em></p>
        <h1 id="a-reading-from-the-gospel-of-mark">A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h1>
        <p><em>The herdsmen fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that
                had happened. And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind,
                the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told what had happened
                to the demoniac and to the swine. And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their neighborhood. And as
                he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be
                with him. But he refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has
                done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decap′olis
                how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.</em></p>
        <h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
        <p>Christ gives himself generously to everyone.
            He gives the greatest gift—the gift of becoming eternally like him.
            And he gives without measure, making the greatest personal sacrifice.
            As we try to imitate Christ’s merciful works, we can think of how to imitate Christ’s love in each of those
            actions. </p>
        <p>First, we can think of what we should give.
            Money?
            Kind thoughts?
            A smile?
            Those gifts have their proper place and time.
            However, all our gifts need to be rooted fundamentally in the gift of Christ to others.<br>This does not
            mean that we need to stand on a street corner and yell out the Gospel at the top of our lungs; it means that
            we should not be afraid to tell others the most important news in the world, that Jesus loves them and wants
            to make them like himself. </p>
        <p>As Jesus shows us in the Gospel today, responding to someone’s pain and need, motivated by the love of
            Christ, will communicate the mystery of Jesus.
            This can be terrifying, as people even fled from the wondrous power of Christ’s love.
            They needed someone to make them understand the benevolence of that power, to witness to the healing of
            Jesus’ powerful love.
            Jesus does not let the man who had been miserably possessed by demons come with him.
            Instead, he sends him to give witness to others. </p>
        <p>We also need to be witnesses.
            We will reflect on the ways to respond to the material needs of others later this week, but we always need
            to remember that our material gifts are for the sake of sharing the Gospel.</p>
        <p>Today, ask Jesus to tell you how he wants you to respond to his mercy.
            In what way is he saying to you, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for
            you.”
            Whom should you tell?
            How do you communicate the Gospel with the kind of love that will make others wonder and desire to know more
            instead of fleeing away in fear or anger? </p>

        <h2 id="week-3-action-items">Week 3 Action Items</h2>
        <ol class="short-list">
            <li>Make good use of time.</li>
            <li>Discipline and train your body and soul. </li>
            <li>Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. Make good use of time.</strong>
            If we are to guard our time of prayer, this will require staying focused on what needs to be done and
            avoiding distractions.
            When you have work that needs to be done on the computer, get it done.
            Complete the task at hand, then get off the computer.
            Hide your mobile device if that would help.
            The fundamentals of freedom are simple.</p>
        <p>Stepping back from distractions is a gift.
            Use well the time that to you once was “lost and now has been found” (see Luke 15:32).
            Get outside your room and visit with your neighbor, your cousin, or your wife.
            Relish your time of prayer and sit with your daily Scripture reading and reflection, being nourished by
            them. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Discipline and train your body and soul.</strong>
            Your time of exercise can help you enter into asceticism.
            Try to maintain a regular schedule of exercise three days a week.
            The training and discipline of the body is an image of the interior battle as well.</p>
        <p>Just as we must sacrifice regularly to get in shape, so we must commit to regular spiritual exercises.
            Fasting helps us to discipline and strengthen our will, putting the needs of the spirit before the body.
            Lean into Lenten fasting and abstinence with Christ.
            Even as we build discipline, he is the one who, through this fasting and penance, is making you a new man.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Avoid grumbling and encourage others.</strong>
            St. Benedict warned his monks that grumbling would undo all of their spiritual progress.
            As we get further along, we will become more tempted to grumble at those snacks we see but can’t have, and
            our sacrifices may tempt us to become impatient.
            Try to stay focused on your why and offer your sacrifice to God in love.</p>
        <p>It also helps to acknowledge God’s grace regularly. At the end of every night, we are called to pause and
            examine our day with the Lord.
            Don’t forget to give God thanks for the many graces of the day—even the graces to see where you fell short
            and the desire to do better the next day.
            If we keep the right attitude, we can help keep others focused too.
            Try to offer encouragement to your family and fraternity to stay focused on Lent.
            If you avoid grumbling and stay rooted in humility and love, you will be a good witness for them. </p>
