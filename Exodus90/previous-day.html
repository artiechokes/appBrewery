        <p>Each day, it's important to take your bearings. Where are you today? In this Lenten exercise, in the
            scriptures, in your daily life, and in your very self? Spend just a minute or two getting your bearings for
            the day.</p>

        <p>Let's briefly examine where we are in this Lenten exercise and then begin each day with a prayer for
            transformation--for ourselves, our fraternity brothers, and all Exodus Men.</p>

        <p><b>You are outside the gates of Paradise.</b> Remember the glory that God has called you to, how you have
            fallen from that glory, and how much you depend on his saving help. </p>

        <p>Pray the Lord blesses you and your fraternity with a foundation for real personal change during this season
            of Lent.</p>

        <p>Pray for the grace of perseverance for all Exodus Men, just as they are praying for you.</p>

        <p><i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i></p>

        <p><i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is
                in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i></p>

        <h2>A Reading from the Gospel of Mark</h2>

        <p><i>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came
                up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a
                dove; and a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased." The Spirit
                immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by
                Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</i></p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>When the Messiah comes to John the Baptist, he asks John to baptize him, to admit him into the ranks of
            repentant sinners. What an awesome and terrifying paradox. How can John baptize and instruct the Christ whom
            John was preparing by penance to welcome? How can he share his own life of penance with Christ?</p>

        <p>As Jesus arises out of the water, John the Baptist sees the heavens open and "the Spirit descend as a dove
            from heaven and remain on him (John 1:32), and he hears the voice from heaven proclaiming Jesus as the
            beloved Son of God. John not only learns who Jesus is, he learns that the God whom he has served all his
            life is a Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Further still, God the Son is present here to him, being
            baptized. This revelation must have been like an electric shock as John realized that this man before him
            was God the Son. What a profound mystical experience! John had shared in Jesus' own vision of the Holy
            Spirit, and in that moment, he also understood why Jesus wanted to be baptized.</p>

        <p>In the Gospel of St. John the Evangelist, John the Baptist explains the reason by saying, "Behold, the Lamb
            of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). St. Mark, however, prefers to show the meaning
            without spelling it out: immediately after baptism, Jesus is taken by the Spirit into the wilderness for
            forty days to be tempted by Satan. The message is the same in both Gospels: God has become man to take upon
            himself our sins and to make our penance and struggle his own, not because he owes penance, but because he
            wants to enter into our penance and thereby become the lamb who offers his penance as a sacrifice on our
            behalf. He wants to transform our repentance and fasting and other penitential acts into a means of
            transforming us into himself. If we share in Christ's suffering and reparation for sin, then our suffering
            and penance become signs of our closeness to him. And when we share that penance with Christ, we, like John
            the Baptist, will share in Christ's own relationship with his Father. We will hear the Father tell us that
            we are beloved in Christ, and we will receive, in Christ, the gift of the Anointing that makes him Christ
            the anointed. In other words, we will receive the Holy Spirit through our penitential union with Jesus.</p>

        <p>Jesus shows us today that participating in the disciplines he took upon himself for forty days in the
            wilderness is the first step in allowing him to transform us. Let us follow Jesus into the desert of Lent,
            repenting with him. The wilderness of our penance is transformed into a garden of Eden (cf. Isaiah
            41:17-20), another place of joy because God is with us. Let us joyfully undertake our penance, therefore,
            knowing that in doing so, we are clinging ever closer to our God Incarnate, Jesus Christ.</p>

        <p><i>Now place yourself before God, and converse with him. If making a holy hour is a new practice for you,
                consider using the <a

        <h2>Today's Action Item</h2>

        <p><b>Write Your Why.</b> We all need transformation in Christ. It is important to begin Lent with a clear
            intention of how you need to experience this transformation. Why have you decided to do this spiritual
            exercise? While we all can acknowledge that we have not served God and our families perfectly, it helps to
            have specific goals for growth over these forty days.</p>

        <p>Exodus, including this Lenten exercise, is a movement of God's people from slavery to the promised land. What
            are your particular dependencies and attachments? We can make a potential list: sports, email, mobile
            devices, work, television, videos, video games, food, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, smoking, money, stock
            trading, news, homework, public appearance, power, control, hobbies, gambling, materialism, laziness,
            activism, and narcissism. All too often in our day, men have become enslaved to pornography and
            masturbation. We are all enslaved in different ways, but things can change.</p>

        <p>Lent provides an opportunity, but how will you take advantage of it? Take the time today <a
                href="field-guide/what-is-your-why.html">to write your why</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="note">Arturo's Note: Write down your why in notebook or phone. Exodus will ask you to
                reference back to your why on future days.</span> </p>

        <p>Be honest about those things from which you need to be freed. Be honest with yourself, with your brothers,
            and with the Lord. This honesty is a vital step toward transformation. Offer your why to the Lord in prayer,
            making it a spiritual sacrifice. Remember that the focus is not a negative turning away from things but a
            positive embrace of the Lord and others in love. Love is the most powerful motivation, helping to focus on
            what matters most. If we are embracing Lent for God and to love others more, it will be more powerful than
            simply trying to stop bad habits.</p>
